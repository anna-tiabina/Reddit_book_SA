"How to get out of a reading slump, I want to get back into reading again I started reading A little life a month ago and it got me in a reading slump because I don't like the genre and I got so bored halfway through it, also how long it is turned me off, now I'm trying to get back into reading so I need some tips and some great book recommendations that'll keep me hooked",0
"Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology Seen her on her series ""Leah Remini; Scientology and the aftermath"". I wanted to read it. It's a good read. Scientology is cruel. I feel she needs to write a sequel. She needs to now expose Scientology from the people she's interviewed. If they want to tell their story. Yes Leah definitely did see both sides of Scientology. From the grassroots and from a celebrity point of view.

Have you read it? What did you think? Very interesting,insightful, eye opening book from my pov.",1
"What do you think of maps in a novel? I am just wondering because I feel like I am the only person who enjoys having the map. I read a lot of fantasy-type books and I spend a decent amount of time studying and referencing the maps but friends of mine say they barely even glance at the maps. 

I just like to know where things are and have a visual of where characters are and what the terrain may be like.. I also get a sense of scale if they are travelling - LOTR included a great map of Mordor and I think it made reading them much more enjoyable. 

I am just about to start the *The Folk of the Air* series and when I opened up The Cruel Prince and saw the map of Elfhame I got very excited.. I just feel like the book is going to be full of adventure if the author felt the need to include a map.",1
"Clowns as Protagonists Anybody else ever read a good book with a clown as the main character?  

There are a couple of operas I know of - Rigoletto and Pagliacci - and Heinrich Boll (the o has an umlaut) wrote a book called (in its English translation - he wrote in German) The Clown that just took me by storm for about twenty minutes back in the 1990s.  I mean, the instant I finished it I started reading it again, and read it through three times in a row without stopping.  And now I don't even know why.  Can't even imagine why.  It all happened to a very different person, I guess... the me now is not the me that was.  So.  Any other novels with clowns as protagonists?  (Not It, please.  Thank you.)

In operas, the fact that the protagonist is a clown is a very effective technique, I think.  I'm kind of surprised it hasn't been done more.  Making your hero someone whose job is to make people laugh is like making your hero someone others spit on for fun.  In spite of the fact that we all love comedy and comedians, and none of us spits on anyone for fun.  Well, most of us love comedy.  I imagine there are those who don't, but I wouldn't want to spend much time with such people.  You might get a similar effect by making your hero a lawyer.  I mean, nobody likes lawyers, right?  But if your son or daughter becomes a lawyer you're proud as hell, aren't you?  That dichotomy, between what ""people"" think and what people think... it's interesting.

Boll's hero was also a clown, but he was a respectable clown, someone who made money at it freelance.  He was nobody's paid buffoon, he was a professional.  And so that Rigoletto-feeling was completely absent from the book.  Not a hint of anything like that.

Novels with clowns as protagonists... or novels that take advantage of the difference between what people think and what ""people"" think, in their protagonists.  Anything?",1
"I read The Road by Cormac McCarthy for the first time, and was surprised to find I enjoyed it. A friend recommended me this book when we were discussing about dystopian novels. I got a copy from a local library and as I read it, I got pretty bored because the wording style was bleak and empty to me. I was going to put it down, but as the story progressed, I was touched by the relationship between the father and the son and decided to stick around for a little longer. My original feelings about the book started to fade away as I got through the middle-ish part and I became genuinely invested in the story. By the end, I was into full on tears because of how bittersweet the conclusion between the father and son was and how the son carried on the fire. 

Usually I wouldn't recommend continuing reading a story if it seems boring to you, but I'm glad I waited for The Road.",0
"Just finished reading ""None Shall Sleep"" by Laura Giebfried (in the Damnatio Memoriae series). Loved it. I just finished this book yesterday and I really loved it, it had such a strong winter atmosphere, I could practically feel the cold and hear the crush of slush. And I *loved* the characters. It covers tough subjects and it's very dark and depressing, but I found myself engaged the whole time and empathizing with the main character Enim a lot in his frustrations.

Has anyone else read this? I can't find any mention of it in Reddit. I plan to read the second and third book in the trilogy, but I need a mood cleanser before I start cause it was just such a depressing (but good!) read.",1
"Unique storytelling and all that Shakespeare invented/popularised many of the archetypes of storytelling. Possibly. 

Who are the authors(or their works) you like that do not necessarily fall into one of the ""traditional"" story telling category.

I've recently discovered Erin Morgenstern's ""The Night Circus"" and about to finish ""The Starless Sea"" and both are in a way comparable to something that's already been done, in a manner of approach, but the unfolding stories are, or seem, somwewhat new to me. Yet familiar somehow.",1
"Which quote from a novel compelled you to read that entire novel? I have for a long time experienced that couples who are in love have a similar physical appearance (the face at least) which was not what others around me believed and then I read this quote which made me read the entire book: “He looks like you because you brought him up, and you look like me because we gazed and gazed at each other for so many years. Loving couples come to resemble each other.”

"Isn't this just stoicism? (The Courage to be Disliked, by Kishimi and Koga) This is the most relatable philosophical work I have ever read. The ""youth"" is literally me, unironically - grew up with low self esteem, jealous of other people, highly competitive so unable to participate in other people's happiness, had a lonely youth that he tried to filled with books etc. 
Also, I thought NEET was a meme term coined on 4chan, turns out it was used by Alfred Adler in the exact same sense?",1
"The change in the literary world  In my adolescence (when I had more free time) I did a literary year, those famous ones where you read a book from each country, it was a very famous challenge at the time and many blogs and even here on reddit there were many tips on which books to read, even so it was a very difficult challenge to do, good books were very hard to find mainly because of the language barrier and sometimes reading wasn't worth it.

 I just finished reading “Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows” and started reading “If We Lived in a Normal Place for Juan Pablo Villalobos” and I have on my list ""Babel for R. F. Kuang"" and even though it's not really my style “Tender Is the Flesh for Agustina Bazterrica” has been highly recommended. And I started to think about what it would be like to do a literary challenge right now.

They are all great books by authors of different nationalities, when I was a teenager and I found a book like Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Haruki Murakami that was the culmination of a week or sometimes a month of a lot of research, and they seemed to be almost unique, but now I feel that it is easier to find these amazing books. 

 I know we've always had famous authors of different nationalities (Umberto Eco, Tolstoy, Miguel de Cervantes) I don't deny the quality of their works or the due fame, but they are not easy books to read, and they are placed on a pedestal that makes reading difficult for the average person. (who doesn't really want to study the nuances of writing)

 Perhaps the ease that current technology offers has a role in this, but for me there is really a change in the way the literary industry advertises books and in the quality they deliver, I can see authors that I would never have access to before.",1
"Has anyone read Timothy Zahns Blackcollar? Tl;Dr Looking to start a discussion on Blackcollar cause no one else I know irl will read books or sci-fi books in general. I thought the book itself was rough but does many things I personally love, so screw it. Also very messy writing, I'm typing on my phone and I didn't proof read alot sorry.

I've recently been reading Timothy Zahn books after reading his Star Wars Thrawn Trilogy. I haven't read too many of his books because I'm being stupidly particular, as in I'm reading his books from release order. Yes, it's inconvenient for me to do, but it feels right for my autistic brain. That being said, I cheated and read the Backlash Mission before starting A Coming of Age, I am a cretin.

One of the big reasons I'm making this post is because I have a hard time finding forums or discussions about this book. Im curious to see how others feel specifically about Blackcollar or even any other Timothy Zahn book. Im truly looking for other opinions since I have no creative analytical skills of my own (at the moment) for books compared to my critical skills with film or video games.

Anyways, here are my own thoughts on Blackcollar: it was kinda rough. After reading the Thrawn books, Blackcollar felt lacking in comparison. I'm going on a limb, and that might just be because it's Zahns first book, and both a coming of age and the backlash mission are much stronger and compelling. I think the biggest issue is the characters. Not only are there too many, but most of them lack dimensions and traits that i expect from characters. Hell, some of them kinda blend in my mind. Before Backlash, I probably couldn't have separated Hawking from Jensen. I'm also not super huge on the protagonist Caine, like he's not terrible but...he's kinda stale and a tad annoying. Once again, he's much more fun and tolerable to follow in backlash.

That being said, I'd probably read this book 100 times over. It's very easy to read for a dimwit like me, the plot is compelling even if it's considering standard thriller writing, I dissed the characters but Lathe is kind of a fun wild card to follow. The world itself is captivating. The way humanity gets transformed into willing slaves is fascinating. Some of the world is a bit dated and goofy, like how people will still use tapes what like 3 decades in the future? Im cool with it, especially since it's a world with super human ninjas.

The way zahn writes to me is so compelling that it makes alot of the weaker aspects minuscule when it comes to my entertainment. That's also probably cause it ticks my Sci-fi checklist, fun sci-fi concepts, interesting world and history.",0
"How the hell do I read and ENJOY Only Revolutions by Mark Danielewski? I loved House of Leaves and it would not be a reach at all to call it my favorite book. I've read it twice and will surely read it a third time. I bought Only Revolutions a few years ago for like a buck and thought I'd enjoy the challenge but its just... too much. It's disappointing because I enjoy experimental fiction once in a while. Joyce Carol Oates, Jenny Offill, etc. And want desperately to like and understand this novel because I so enjoyed his writing style and the challenge in HOL but every time I try I find myself annoyed.",0
"Are the principles of Joseph Murphy practical? I recently finished reading the book ""The Power of your Subconscious Mind"", and the author Dr. Joseph Murphy has mentioned a number of anecdotes to prove that the subconscious mind can achieve unimaginable things if you suggest it correctly, is this true? Has anyone ever achieved anything by this method? Also, the author has written that we should repeat a few lines as a form of suggestion to our brain and it will eventually come to pass, especially when we are dizzy. Is there any evidence to support this statement or is it just the author fooling us?",1
"1984: What An Experience Decided it was time to go ahead and read this classic as somehow we skipped over it in school (read Animal Farm though). Truly a haunting, thought provoking, hit you in the gut book. Orwell is not only great with his ideas, but his delivery of them is incredible with fantastic use of emotions both noticeable and subtle. The different acts of the book succeed in having a different feel and trajectory to them and the imagery he conjures up is very poignant and vivid.

SPOILERS BELOW JUST IN CASE...

I thought something was up with the visions he was having of O'Brien and that lurking feeling behind the wall, and it turns out the Party had infiltrated his mind. How did they start planting the thoughts and trust in O'Brien? He mentioned that they were on to him for the past seven years and I'm guessing that was when he found the photo that proved the Party lied? Also curious about when he saw the men in the photograph at the bar and all of a they had broken noses... what was up with that? Additionally, how exactly can they read his mind? I understand they are good at noticing what you generally might be thinking but O'Brien knew exactly what he was thinking in the interrogation. And finally how did they get him to go to the shop where the owner was actually Thought Police? A lot might just be up in the air due to the nature of the Party but curious nonetheless if anyone could clear this up or had theories. Also the talking behind the picture legitimately gave me the creeps with the reveal.

Really depressing book on the whole but a must read for everyone.",1
"Arthur C. Clarke's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"": The most wonderful work of science fiction I've ever read! So tonight I have completed one of the most Iconic works of science fiction, Arthur C. Clarke's ""2001: A Space Odyssey""! Essentially enough it is the novel version of the famed film of the same name that Clarke himself had co written with the renowned director, the late Stanley Kubrick. Both the book and film were developed simultaneously, with the film being released first with the book being released afterwards.

Despite the differences between both in terms of narrative, they both detail a very spectacular epic. Essentially it is an allegory of the exploration of space undertaken by man. A Journey that first began in the African savannas millions of years ago. To be honest, just simply explaining the plot alone wouldn't do it justice! But nonetheless it is a fantastic work.

Like the first three novels of Ursula K. Le Guin's Hainish Cycle ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is just so spellbinding! From start to right up to the finish it is super captivating! I am impressed to such an extent that I can hardly put it to words! Think in the near future I might check out more of the late author's works including a couple of his other great works, most specifically ""Childhood's End"" and ""Rendezvous with Rama"".",1
"Lolita: Am I missing something? Okay, I get it, the prose is great. Nabokov is clearly an extremely talented writer. But I don't really care how beautiful the writing is when i realize I've just read 3 entire pages of a nearly 40 year old man jerking off next to a 12 year old, talking about how he's going to ""preserve her innocence"" by molesting her in her sleep. And then part 2 of the book is just long winded descriptions of various American landmarks and secluded cabins. 

At no point have I felt sympathy for Humbert, at no point have I even found him ""unreliable"" as everyone loves to say - he's very aware that he's a pervert and very aware that Dolores is unhappy. 

What am I missing? What is it about this book that people love? It's literally always mentioned in ""best books I've ever read"" lists and I genuinely don't get it.",0
"Complementary book pairs Quite by accident, I happen to have read Steinbeck's ""The Pearl"" and Wagamese's ""Ragged Company"" within a few months of one another. In both books, people living in poverty stumble upon amazing fortune, but directions that the authors take the stories couldn't be more different. I have loved thinking about the books together, and how the times and environments of the authors might've influenced their perspectives.

What other book pairs have you come across that have given you a kick?",1
"Reading The Shining made me like the movie less. I really love the depth they go into the family, where Jack seems genuinely remorseful about what he did to Danny and his drinking. Wendy seems to be a strong and loving mother/wife. His descent into madness was great, because he just keeps slipping and recovering, before giving in.

Jack Nicholson seems like he's about to go on a spree right in the opening scene, and Shelley Duvall seems like she's already scared he's about to kill them",1
"Dean koonts, the other Emily I’ve been having a hard time reading for years and this was one of the first books that kept my attention so deeply, and I’m very disappointed in the ending. 

I won’t spoil anything for anybody but there were a few plot points I figured out ahead of time which is no big deal for me in terms of enjoyment.

but the big ending characters seemed so cheap sci-fi to me it kind of ruined the rest of the book. 

Sorry if this isn’t the most eloquent post but it’s my first time posting here and I just want someone else’s opinion because I loved this book up until the end.",1
"Walden, by Thoreau I had never read this book before.  I was aware of it from my youth, though - didn't Doonesbury and his crowd start a commune they called Walden II? - and ""knew"" the standard trivia about it that would get you through a round or two of Jeopardy.  I haven't finished it yet, and it doesn't seem likely that I will, since I got kind of tired of his (Thoreau's) fatuous enfant terrible vibe, repetitiveness and ignorant mysticism about philosophy.  He had so much free time, and did so little with it... it's a shame, really.  ...Oh, me?  what have I done?  Why do you ask lol?

I guess the most startling thing about it was how much that he had to say that, although I had never read it before, gave me the impression it was stuff everyone is well aware of and nobody talks about at all ever.  It's as though his ideas about how people ought to live exist in a kind of group subconscious and are passed from one generation to the next, not verbally but through the genes, or perhaps through some as yet undiscovered secret door in a garden wall somewhere, through which angels with messages pass back and forth, not between God and man but between one generation and the next.

He was the author of the phrase:  the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.  In this simple phrase is encapsulated the horror of growing up, of entering into society, and of spending all your time and all your energy on what may (and almost certainly will) be worthless.  The horror of bending yourself all out of shape to work some job requiring you to please people you care nothing for day in and day out, and for what:  for luxury you don't need and company you don't want.  And say what you will against Thoreau, he could turn a phrase.  Speaking of local farmers:  ""Why should they eat their sixty acres, when man is condemned to eat only his peck of dirt?  Why should they begin digging their graves as soon as they are born?""  Speaking of the social work that is required to get by:  ""...that you may persuade your neighbor to let you make his shoes, or his hat, or his coat, or his carriage, or import his groceries for him; making yourself sick, that you may lay something up against a sick day.""  Speaking of testing his life, to find out how good it has been:  ""We might try our lives by a thousand simple tests; as, for instance, that the same sun which ripens my beans illumines at once a system of earths like ours.  If I had remembered this it would have prevented some mistakes.  This was not the light in which I hoed them.""

His fundamental point seems to be that people do way too much work for way too little that is of value in return, and they should work less and care for their minds and their souls, instead.  Oddly enough, this was precisely the point that got me banned from r/GreenandPleasant \- a point I made completely in ignorance of Thoreau's advance work, and a point you would have expected those on the left to remember with reverence.  It's certainly not something conservatives wish on the rest of us.  Well; the more things change, etc etc.

I suppose the weakest part of the whole deal is his mystic attitude to philosophy.  What does he expect people to do with all this free time they'll have?  He fantasizes a bit vaguely about a nation of philosophers - I think there was one once, and the Sumerians made pretty short shrift of them, taking their women and their precious metals - but his own free time seems to have been spent less on philosophy than on enjoying sunrises and rainstorms and events of that nature.  Well:  people don't get out as much as they should, there's no doubt of that, and if people were to live in the woods they might discover that, in cities, even their outside air is conditioned beyond recognition; beyond that, there isn't room any more for our millions in forests, and so we must have cities.  None of that is what I would call useful philosophy.

And I might add that it's not nearly as easy today as it was in his time to live outside.  Our government has taken the fear of terrorism as an excuse to make it much harder for people to live homelessly.  Those who run the government know, I'm sure, that if we do not persuade people as hard as possible to live in apartments and houses the value of such things will go down, and that would never do.  If this persuasion amounts to cruelty, well, nobody cares and so it's not important.  That's who we have become, unfortunately.  And perhaps we always were, and only covered it up with a phony morality that was basically for the neighbors' consumption, so they wouldn't realize what we really were.

And on that depressing note...",0
"Hillbilly Elegy: I'm surprised JD Vance is a Trump supporter The (nonfiction) book Hillbilly Elegy describes author (JD Vance)'s childhood in the Appalachian culture.  It spends a lot of time talking about the history, worldview, and culture of the Appalachian area and why that demographic are now mostly republicans. He writes about how lucky he was that his grandma raised him and that he was able to escape poverty and get a higher education. I thought it was a really good book that explained the culture and perspective well.

A few years ago when I read the book I thought that he recognized a cycle of poverty and knew that he was lucky get an education. And he seemed politically center to slightly-left-of-center and was using his history to understand and explain why rural poor people are voting against their own best interests. 

Now he is the senator elect for Ohio and is apparently very conservative and got endorsed by Trump. I have no idea if I severely misunderstood him in his book or if his views have changed, or if he just sold out to get support and get elected.

Has anyone else read Hillbilly Elegy? What was your impression?",1
"""The Younger Wife"" by Sally Hepworth I just finished this book and I was actually kinda disappointed? I mostly feel the ending kinda left everything out in the open, too many unanswered questions. The ""twist"" at the very end that the money in the water bottle was actually from Pam's mother who was only hoarding this money to cheat on her taxes was a pretty lame twist. I felt introducing Fiona Arthur only to end up barely exploring her seemed like kind of a waste. The subplot with Tully's kleptomania was dumb, and Tully herself was just annoying 95% of the time, and what was the point of talking about her 3-year-old shitting on the rug? I thought Rachel was one of the more interesting characters, especially regarding her backstory and her final act, but I wish we would have heard more about her feelings towards her father after his death, was she remorseful? If she wasn't, I can't entirely blame her considering he was choking her mother, sounded like justifiable homicide. His death and the aftermath reminded me a bit of >!Big Little Lies, !<a shitty guy is justifiably killed but instead they lie about it. Also who was Rachel's r\*pist? I know often times victims don't know who their assailant is, but I kept waiting to find out who it was but it never happened. I didn't hate Heather, and I thought her backstory of having a father in prison for killing her mom was interesting, but I wish they'd done more with it. I kept thinking the twist was gonna be that Pam was faking her dementia and killed him by ""accident"" and made herself look senile and weak so she'd get away with it.",0
"The Director of Mulan just released a book called The Happy Place. From what I've read so far I love it.  The setting is a small Tennessee town in 1969 where a young man  aspiring to be Jimi Hendrix is on his way to Woodstock. He meets an  artist at the local diner and she asks if she can paint his portrait  back at her studio and that's where the drama and death unfold! haha   Apparently the setting is based off the writer's childhood home in Tennessee.

"Reading Nabokov's Lolita: What is going on? I get that Humbert says some wild stuff, lies, tall tales and what not, but I don't understand what he means at the beginning of Chapter 27:

>Finally, I did achieve an hour's slumber -- from which I was aroused by gratuitous and horribly exhausting congress with a small hairy hermaphrodite, a total stranger.

What?! Is he saying he had sex with a hermaphrodite? It seems such a bizarre thing to say in a book of bizarre things to say.",0
"Just finished The Masterpiece by Francine Rivers, was anybody else taken out of it by all of the religious talk? I picked up the book at the library, I read the summary and thought it sounded interesting. I figured it would just be a wholesome type of romance, and I was super invested. I feel bad that the investment started to fade when basically by the end chunk of the book, it was suddenly a bunch of talk about God and Jesus, giving your life to the Lord, all that. It kinda put me off, I finished the book anyway, and I feel so underwhelmed. Kinda left a bad taste in my mouth. Anybody else read this book? Any thoughts?? I'd love to know if anybody felt the same as me, or otherwise. The main girl is a Christian, but the religion stuff really went hard out of nowhere towards the end.",0
"""What am I missing with this book?"" thread! I just finished reading Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler. I love sci fi and I know this one is hugely acclaimed but it just didn't click with me. I found the MC a bit cloyingly perfect and the other characters bland. I felt like I was reading a mission statement rather than a novel. 

Whenever I read a super famous book like this and don't get it, I always end up wishing I could understand WHY people love it so much.

"What is the most profound, life changing book you have ever read? Are there any books that you would say split your life into two parts - before you read the book, and after. Books that deeply shifted your perspective on your life in some way. How did these books change you?

If I was to choose one, it would have to be Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro. When I see the cover art I feel an odd sense of nostalgia. The prose feel very delicate and thoughtful, which ultimately lends itself to how heartbreaking the story is. In time I think I will read it again, as I'm sure my perspective towards things will change with age. 

I appreciate the natural tangents that the book goes on. Items in the environment will sometimes have a story connected to them, which helps to more deeply understand the characters as you watch them grow into adults. It adds depth to the little things that a person may not think twice about. I sometimes catch myself thinking about little things in my own life in the same way. I developed a greater appreciation for the journey that not only I go on, but the everyday items in my life also go on, and the memories they carry. 

I feel as though the book has helped me to be more prepared for the emotions that life has to offer. I've always struggled with understanding and embracing my emotions. Childlike innocence and curiosity, teenage angst, love, hope, rage, grief, patience, forgiveness, and so much more is touched upon subtly, but tenderly, through the characters and their flaws. It displays drama with a very human and grounded lense. It is a very accurate depiction of what it means to feel.",1
"Is Clare, ('The Time Traveler's Wife') ""tone-deaf"", insensitive, or just plain stupid? **Note:** I read the book many years ago, so my recollection is sometimes blurry. Also, I hated this book to the point that I stopped reading ""leisure"" books for many years; so keep in mind that I'm not a fan.

After Henry lost his feet, Clare - the ever so ""artistic"" person that she is - made Henry ""wings"" since he could no longer walk.

Wings! made out of paper-mache (I think?) that she painted red and handed from the ceiling of her art studio, all under the guise of cheering him up by telling him that, and I'm paraphrasing, ""since he could no longer walk, she made him wings."" Since it's fiction, and Henry is a love-struck fool who didn't heed the warning of his father-in-law, he appreciated it (and I think he even cried).

However, I doubt that that would work in the real world for a normal person.

Imagine if you lost your feet, could no longer walk, had to use a wheelchair, and your arts-major spouse made you ""wings."" I'm sure I would throw the work ""fuck"" at some point in whatever sentence manages to come out of my mind after the shock.

Is she tone-deaf, insensitive, or just plain stupid?

Quite honestly, I am convinced that she is a selfish b-word who only cares about herself; especially after sleeping with her best-friend's husband twice and not feeling any remorse at all.",0
"Has James Patterson's Writing Become Formulaic and Mass-Produced?  

I recently picked up a copy of James Patterson's ""Guilty Wives"" and while I have to admit that it's a page-turner, I can't help but feel disappointed in the accuracy of the portrayal of the prison system in the book. As someone who lives in Switzerland, I can say with certainty that the prison system in France is not as harsh as it's depicted in the book.

I know that it's fiction and the author has the right to take creative liberties, but the fact that the prison system is portrayed so inaccurately is just one example of the unreliability of Patterson's writing. I don't want to bash the man or his work, but I have to say that I'm not a fan of his writing. It feels formulaic and lacks depth.

I understand that Patterson has a massive fanbase and his books are wildly popular, but I can't help but feel like his writing is just a product of the publishing industry. It's formulaic and mass-produced, which is fine if that's what you're looking for, but it's not for me.

I'm not saying that Patterson is a terrible writer, but I definitely prefer other authors over him. There are so many amazing writers out there who put so much effort and thought into their work, and I feel like Patterson's writing just doesn't compare.

In the end, ""Guilty Wives"" was an entertaining read, but I can't help but feel let down by the inaccuracies and the overall lack of depth in Patterson's writing. If you're looking for a quick and easy read, then his books might be for you, but I personally will be avoiding his work in the future.",0

"Favorite History Book I’m curious for those readers of history in this sub to talk about their favorite history books. The focus is on non-fiction, so things like biographies of historical figures, books detailing important figures, and much, much more. The book can focus on a very niche subject or it can cover a whole lot. I just want to hear about your favorite and why it is for whatever reason!

Edit:

Forgot to share my favorite history book, which is ***The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano*** by Olaudah Equiano in 1789.

It is a autobiography that gives a lot of insight into the life and experiences of slaves brought to America through the slave trade. It discusses the quickly changing life of someone that is a slave being bought and sold to other families, what it was like being on a slave boat, the different stories and experiences pass around amongst slaves. The things I learned from this book were both inspiring and heartbreaking to say the least, while teaching me a out of things about Equiano's life.

I know there are some controversies behind this book due to some of the historical elements not lining up and the belief that Equiano embellished some of his accounts of events, but I think there can be a lot that can be learned from this book. This is why I really it and believe it to hold a lot of historic value for someone trying to learn about the Slave Trade using firsthand accounts from the perspective of a slave.",1
"Emily Eden, or what to read after Austen I don't know how frequently this occurs, but immediately after I made my way through Jane Austen's canon (admittedly a few times over), I set out on a quest to find another author whose work I could enjoy as much as I do her's.  I can't say I've been particularly successful because, at least for me, no one can touch Austen, but it hasn't been entirely unproductive.  One author that I found, and subsequently always recommend to anyone looking for something to read once they are through Austen, is Emily Eden.    
Eden only wrote two novels: The Semi-Detached House (1859) and The Semi-Attached Couple (1860) and it's a pity she never wrote more because they are delightful.  Austen was her favorite author and she writes in a similar style, especially in her secondary characters, many of whom are quite Austen-esque (Mrs. Douglas out of The Semi-Attached Couple especially seems as if she walked straight out of Meryton).    
As far as I can tell, both the novels are out of print, but are public domain so can be found online. I tracked down a really beautiful 1947 copy on Abebooks with the fun little added interest of an introduction by Anthony Eden, former British prime minister and Emily Eden's great-great-grandnephew.",1
"I absolutely loved “The Martian”. I also absolutely loved “Project Hail Mary”. I’m thinking Andy Weir is an amazing author, so naturally I bought “Artemis” without hesitation and… What a monumental letdown. It feels like it was written by a horny teenager with no prior writing experience. The overly contrived angst and lackluster storytelling set in a world with no real allure despite being a freaking MOON BASE was boring at best and cringey at worst. Plus, the ending is so poorly executed compared to the endings of Weir’s other novels, it’s hard to believe that it was written by the same guy. I’ve literally read and listened to The Martian and Project Hail Mary so many times I’ve lost count. But I will not be returning to Artemis. 
Rant over.

Edit: Well, I woke up to a lot of feedback. If you liked Artemis, that’s totally fine, we don’t have to like the same things. I just felt like sharing my experience with, and opinion on, the book. I listened to the audiobook, and while it wasn’t my favorite by far, I still got through the whole thing, which isn’t always the case.",0
"War and Peace- 50 shades of humans? I am reading this for the second time, and what struck me as highly interesting and commendable is that Tolstoy never calls out a villain as such - at least in most cases, he doesn't. So, even if Boris is a social climber and an opportunist, he is presented without any implicit judgment- it's up to the reader to decide whether they like him or not... 

It's almost like an impressionist painting, where the painter is presenting their own impressions of the scene in front of them. The viewer can decide what their feelings are after looking at the paining... would you agree?",1
"Most disturbing book you’ve ever read? For me, it’s My Absolute Darling by Gabriel Tallent. The graphic depictions of the sexual, emotional and physical abuse this girl goes through my her father in the redwood wilderness is hard to read but like witnessing a bad car wreck, it’s hard to look away. The writing was unique and the scenery, as well as the main character herself, was hopeful and had a sense of demented beauty to it. Definitely not for the faint of heart tho. 

Other disturbing books I’ve read are:
Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov 
My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell 
All the Ugly and Wonderful Things by Bryn Greenwood 
Flowers in the Attic by VC Andrews 
Forbidden by Tabitha Suzuma. 
I recommend all of them if you can stomach them.",1
"Anyone read The Box Man by Kobo Abe - what did you make of it? I found this such a confusing book! Here's my book review, and I'd be curious to know what others thought of it and how you interpreted it:

*It was an extremely odd book, written in many different forms ranging from story to an affidavit to a police report, and with no clear narrator, or possibly several switches in narrator - everything is very ambiguous when it comes to the identity of both the narrator and the described box men.*

*It begins describing what a box man is and then moves onto detailing the shooting of one who is trespassing on another's land. We also hear of someone, perhaps the original narrator, perhaps not, becoming infatuated with a woman acting as a nurse and a fake doctor who is acting as a fake box man, or who may be the box man the fake doctor is pursuing for his studies. The narrator box man - who may indeed be all of these people - possibly has engaged in a deal with nurse, and wants to return the money given to him. As this all unfolds, his obsession with the nurse, and sex, are illustrated, as well as an obsession with SIGHT, SEEING, and really the true identity of people.*

*At the very end, there is a bit about the box man's childhood that may shed light on his sexual psychology and psychology in general. The complex web of characters, narrators, raw sexual desire, and real/fake box men, seems to me to discuss self awareness and identity, particularly in the context of how we fit into society, with box men being outcasts, doctors/soldiers/nurses being active society members, and the boxes the box men use being quite metaphorical displays of rebellion. Photography and what we choose to see or capture also seems to be a key theme. Do we trust what we see, what we hear, what people project?*",0
"After 3.5 years, I have finished The Brothers Karamazov I've lived a lot of life alongside this book. At times i felt as if i was living myself through the book. My copy looks like it's been put in the blender. The cover on both sides is missing and half of the introduction pages have fallen out. 

Each character feels like a different part of me during different times of my life. The insolent, greedy and depraved Fyodor, the spurned, resentful and calculating Smerdyakov, the tortured and conflicted Ivan, the tempestuous, passionate, yet hopeful Mitya. There is a part of me that is also Alyosha and Zosima, and it has come out during magnificent moments in my life, and I hope to feel more of it as I grow older. 

My favorite parts of the book were Fyodor's confrontation with Zosima and Zosima's words to him, ""A man who lies to himself, and believes his own lies, becomes unable to recognize truth, either in himself or in anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself and for others. When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love."" 

I loved the philosophical discussion on judgment 

I also loved the recollections of Zosima and his brother's transformation towards death

I loved the chapters where Ivan and Alyosha are discussing life, faith, and their worldviews. You can see how Ivan wants to believe in a loving, good world but can't with the evidence the world provided him. Alyosha only sees how much pain his brother is in and loves him  in spite of all his hate. 

I loved Mitya hoping to find a hymn in which he would be reborn while suffering in the mines, and feeling as if he must suffer for the entire world. 

I loved Alyosha telling Mitya to imagine the man who would be reborn from that suffering, and to live for the image of that man without needing to suffer for an act he didn't commit. 

The ending is quite beautiful too, with Alyosha saying all one must do if they find themselves giving themselves over to selfishness and to cruelty is to remember a time when they were happy, kind, and good. 






This book helped me through a lot of hard times. It provided to me the example of Alyosha to imagine myself as when I was surrounded by ugliness and pain. I want to be the sort of man that is an ambassador of goodwill when the entire world seems, at times, abandoned to ugliness, greed, and conflict. It is a reminder that goodness is a reward in and of itself, and the alternative is living with the burden of being horrible and living in misery. 

I will read this book at least once before I die, when I am an old man. 


The next Dostoevsky book I'll read is The Prince, maybe next year, when I am not all Dostoevsky'd out.",1
"What Series Have You Put Off Until Recently? I've recently restarted the Inheritance series.  I read the first three around the time that Brisingr came out. When Inheritance came out, it had been long enough that I wanted to reread the others first, but too soon for me to want to. Kept just putting it off until now.

I also read the Emily of New Moon Trilogy, which is one I've surprisingly never read despite having read and greatly enjoyed the Green Gables Series.  

Any of you done the same recently?  Picked up a series you never finished, or started, to give it a go? If so which one(s)?

No spoilers please (I got this far without seeing any Inheritance spoilers, I don't need to trip just before the finish line, lol)",1
"The Extraordinary Life of Sem Hell I just finished listening to the audiobook. It was the free audiobook of the month on Audible. I loved the book. I know some people discuss it because of the religious undertone, and there were some problematic things and there. However, the book moved me : I cried thrice while listening to it.

The story was well written and well constructed. I liked that the timeline wasn't linear and the back and forth between present and past.

Have you read the book or listened to the audiobook? What were your thoughts?",1
"I’m not liking a journey to the center of the earth I bought it from barns and noble and while ago and decided to finally read it and I’m not a fan. The characters feel flat. Most of the book was about getting to Iceland and then getting to the mountain sneffels and going inside then going down into it. Like I was expecting some  cooler to happen and not have that part take 2/3rds of the book. I feel like I’m reading an informative article on a book not a book. When we get to said center, we don’t even have a long time to explore like why is there giant mushrooms but no we learn about how there is light. Jules could’ve have said there was a mini sun down there and I wouldn’t have cared about how or why it’s there. Then we go on some boat ride on an ocean? I haven’t finished it and will update when I do.

Also anyone else think it’s weird how the main character is kinda in love with his cousin.",0
"Zombie fiction is weird Hi! I'm a life long fan of the zombie genre. Mostly because I really really like zombies as a horror device. They are everywhere, they never quit and  you and people you care about might turn into one of them at the smallest bite. 

That's really scary for me. It means that no matter where you go they might turn up in droves without warning. Nowhere is ever really safe, and if they get you you die gruesomely, painfully and might rise again. 

They are also a good plot device for writing social commantary, because a zombie apocalypse would surely level the playingfield, pretty much elimintating the concept of class which makes for good writing. Or the upper class manages to preserve their own position somehow, which also makes for good writing. 

However i feel like the aspects of zombies as a pure horror device was never really pefected? I really like the short stories that Max Brooks put in at the end of the zombie survival guide, and most of world war Z was also really great. But apart from that i've never really seen zombies used as a pure horror device. 

Most zombie fiction revolves around the trope that ""people are the real monsters"" which is a fun concept to explore. But i feel like that is the only thing that zombie fiction ever explores. It's also in my opinion a very dour view on humanity. 

A large part of all zombie fiction also feels the need to have a spin on the zombie concept. WIth zombies either being intelligent, or mutated with special powers that gives them super strenght and speed and maybe psychic powers. Sometimes the zombies are made by aliens or nanobots or AI . 

I guess the Max Brooks short stories are the kind of gold standard (my entirely subjective gold standard) that i've set for myself. And there really does not seem to be a lot of zombie fiction that just uses the zombie concept as a horror device to write really good, claustrophobic but still simple horror stories. 

Is this something that other people agree with  / have noticed? What are your thoughts?",1
"Does listening to an audiobook vs reading a book alter your opinion of the book? I started getting into audiobooks a few years ago, especially with the discovery of the Libby app. It's a great way to pass the time when I'm driving, doing chores, walking the dog, etc. Since then, I have noticed that most of the books that I've strongly disliked the past couple of years were ones that I consumed as audio. There were audiobooks that I loved listening to, so that's obviously not always that case, and of course there were books that I read myself that I didn't like. But it does make me wonder, do I judge audiobooks more harshly than I do books that I simply read myself? Has anyone else experienced this? 

Ultimately though, I could have legitimately listened to ""worse books"" (imo) as audiobooks than the ones that I've read with my eyes. I do still prefer reading physical books. If there's a book I'm particularly exciting about or looking forward to, I'll usually wait to get a regular copy, so that potentially just leaves a pool of more mediocre books as audiobook options.

Obviously it's not a big deal either way! But I am curious to hear about others' experiences, because I don't want to rate these books with a significant bias, nor do I want to cheat myself of enjoying a book. Highly lauded books like Where the Crawdads Sing or The Goldfinch were, in my opinion, surprisingly bad for how often people praise them, and now I'm like ""Wait, would I have loved them if I had read them instead? Am I just missing out now?""",0
"Val McDermid during lockdown I started reading Val McDermid's Tony Hill and Carol Jordan books, in order. I've recently finished the series and thought them excellent, so I thought I'd try something else of hers. I got '1979' from the library, the first in a series about a reporter, written much more recently than the Hill/Jordan books.

I was very disappointed, couldn't relate to the characters, and it seemed poorly written. It felt like the work of a different author, and I gave up after a few chapters, which I rarely do.

Is this just me? If anyone on here has read at least part of both series how did you think they compared? At present I'm planning to try a completely different author rather than start another McDermid series.",0
"Finished Bird's Nest by Shirley Jackson. I liked it, I like Shirley Jackson. Her books are sad and scary in a weirdly elegant way. It's the only word that comes to mind.

Bird's Nest didn't hit the way The Haunting of the Hill house did, but it was still very very good. And a very fast read, because i wanted to come back to it. Even though DID is overused now as a plot-point. And to be honest, after Moon Knight the ''assembling of personality'' doesn't look like a plausible conclusion or an intresting one.

I liked it. I probably shouldn't wait for other books in the same edition, but with the pace i'm getting those books, they hit harder. Absolutely delightful.",1
"Crime and Punishment This is my first time reading Crime and Punishment. 

I borrowed what was available on the Libby app (the Constance Garnett translation). I started reading yesterday and really started to love it, so I decided to read a little more about the book and it's context and more about Dostoevsky. 

I feel foolish for not knowing this, but it turns out there's several translations available (my English teachers would be incredibly disappointed in me for not knowing this is a totally normal thing for translated books). So I did a little more research and it seems like the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation is the preferred one.

I decided to switch to that translation, and reread the last chapter i had just finished to get an idea of the differences, and let me tell you, it's like reading a different book! The Garnett translation is very dry and matter of fact, the Pevear and Volokhonsky version is like suddenly watching a colored television after only watching black and white.

Luckily I'm not far into the book, so now I get to enjoy a better translation going forward. I'm posting this in case some poor English major like myself completely forgot that translations exist so you can choose the right one for a better experience.",1
"""It contained the hoho, which was like a haha only deeper."" Men At Arms - Pratchett Read this book when it first came out in the 90's and spent ten minutes laughing and marvelling at the amazing wit Sir Terry had.

"The Wolf Den What a great book.  I'm in the waiting list for the sequel on my digital library so please don't spoil book 2.  I'm wondering what this sub thought of the book.  Here's some things I would throw out to the group:

\-What would happen should something happen to Felix - would Victoria be a freedwoman in charge of the other wolves?  Would one of the ""bouncers"" inherit the brothel?  Certainly Paris was not in line for this.  Although the cruelty of Felix seemed to have no attachments, he seemed to show some feelings towards her.

\-Paris' father could not have been Felix, could it?  He clearly used Paris for pleasures but, the fact that everything seems so brutal and ""fluid"" with who men took as partners it couldn't be a surprise that he either didn't know or didn't care.  This would certainly add to the heartlessness of Felix if this were the case.

\-The wolves seemed to have some freedom such as when they went fishing or to pick up items at the market. What was stopping them from planning an escape?

\-This might answer my previous question, but the book really puts into perspective what a port town must have been like then and to some degree now.  A bunch of surly men in town for one or two days, open to cause as much ruckus or crime as they could get away.  They're gone the next day and may never be back so good luck trying to catch them.  Hence their aggression with the wolves or really any other woman they may see walking alone.  The author did a great job of getting that across.

\-Amara is clearly more bold and entrepreneurial than the rest of the wolves.  I like how she describes the resentment that builds between here and the others as she gains favor with wealthier clientele.  You can really feel the sense of urgency to get out once the Spanish girls come into play.  The whole book can't take place over more than a year.  Is she feeling her youth slip away during that time because of hard living, or do you think its more of a flavor of the week and the need to strike while the iron is hot?

\-I'm thinking back but have already returned the book - who paid for Amara's freedom?  Was is the first man who had her read to him?  If so, what was he wanting her to show Rufus and dealing with a woman?  Its stated Rufus had experience with other women of the night.

"What is wrong with the “Nightwise” books? I'm not an educated man, I know this, so I'm not asking this in a, ""look how sophisticated I am"" kind way. Im genuinely asking. Why does this book suck? A friend of mine recommend R.S. Belcher's ""Nightwise"" series to me and I just don't think they're well written. I don't know enough about writing or literature to put my finger on exactly why that is though.

"How much of a book do you read to feel fine with marking it as read? First, I know there are a lot of readers that don't keep track of the books they read, they don't care about Goodreads goals or any such thing. I like them but that's not me at the moment. 

I started reading regularly around 2016 and since then I've read tons of books, but I've never skimmed, always read every word. 

I have noticed that the authors of non-fiction often give you chapters upon chapters of examples, or information that in the long run aren't that important **to me** and my current state of knowledge. 

A few days a go I started reading **Manufacturing Consent** and it has an intro, 6 chapters, a conclusion and appendixes. I read the intro, conclusion, chapter 1, and chapter 6, chapter 2. I know for a fact that chapters 2-5 are further examples to prove the point of the book, and since I am happy that I read so much of the book, I know I have gained enough. 

I feel uneasy to ask this question because the first response that I would give is ""you aren't reading for school, read whatever you want for however far you want"", **And I agree with that**.

(Surely you had the same feeling of ""a book should be read cover-to-cover"" at some point)

[this mini-cnversion](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/zlekv5/comment/j0762oz/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is what I concluded if anyone is interested.

My feelings of incompletion are only in the ending. I can't for the life of my figure out what Elle's final decision was.

"Do you read newly released books, or do you stick to the classics? My fiancée loves contemporary poplit authors like Coleen Hoover and books like The Love Hypothesis and Where the Crawdads Sing. 

Most poplit doesn’t appeal to me—I reached this conclusion after reading the drivel that was Ready Player One (just my opinion, I don’t mind if you like it). I think, ultimately, that I believe every great story has already been written. So why try to find something new?

After reading RP1, I decided to try and go back in time, and this began a newfound journey to read the time-tested examples of storytelling through the western canon (I’d like to get into more Japanese authors as well, but I’m keeping it to LATAM/American/English authors for now). 

I know there’s no accounting for taste, and I’m just glad my fiancée reads books at all. But I’ve found it hard to truly love any contemporary books. I suppose that’s the rub, though: today’s books haven’t been around long enough to be inserted into the canon. 

By “today’s books” I guess I mean everything post/internet, as I believe the internet has changed humanity’s relationship with the written word. It’s great as a search tool, but maybe the overall quality of writing among the blockbuster books of the day are in decline compared to yesterday. 

I also think contemporary fiction tends to emphasize plot over characters or themes. Personally, those things are my jam, and that’s why I’m looking forward to reading Cormac McCarthy’s latest books (ironically enough). Any recommendations your have for contemporary books in this vein, I’ll take them!

I’m rambling now, but I’ll pose the question—do you tend to gravitate toward “canonized” literature, or do you like to keep up with what’s popular now? Or do you not fret about that stuff in general?",0
"Reading Sinclair Lewis' Babbitt in 2022 A few stray thoughts:

* George Babbitt's lifestyle seems laughably unattainable to me, and I'd wager it does to most people under 30 as well

* Zenith still works as a harsh critique of the middle class as created by capitalism, and the standardization that capitalism encourages

* Conformity is less relevant as a criticism, since we as society are more open to alternate lifestyles in 2022 and the standard ""house with kids"" is no longer expected

* Sinclair Lewis thought America was full of self-righteous hypocrites, and you can feel his contempt oozing out of every line

I've just finished Behave by Robert M. Sapolsky. It is the first non-fiction that I have finished which makes it even more special. And I am in love with it. 

This book is full of insights, at least for me, full of stories and humour. While being challenging to read(the most complicated stuff is still over my low IQ lol) it tries its best to explain it as easy as possible without insulting your intelligence. 

It has everything to inspire a young learner to become a scientist, to make them passionate. If I were such a youngster myself I would be easily swayed by this book. 

Admittedly, I am now overreacting and frontal cortex (hope i got that right) can't think straight  and I am not a scientist myself etc. so I can't fully appreciate or give a valid critique.

"The Battle Of Hogwarts is overhyped People overhype the Final battle in Harry potter. It's mid. It's boring. After the first reading, it gets boring because there's no suspense or rereadablility.
My argument will be split into 2 Points
#Point 1: Immersion.
We only see the battle from one perspective, Harry's. One perspective for a battle isn't always Bad. Percy Jackson and the Last Olympian does it really well. But Harry doesn't fight. He casts a few spells and defeats Voldemort but in the end, the main character is meant to be powerful. We don't see that. All we get to observe is <!Fred's death, Snape's memories of Lily and James, and Dumbledores plan!>. We don't get the excitement from a battle we should, and like we do in, again, The Last Olympian. We don't feel the danger because Harry is never in Danger. There was more suspense in book Six for its battle then in the Deathly Hallows finale. 

#Point2: Ending.
This point mainly has to do with Harry's boasting in the final clash. Voldemort says that he is more powerful and as such will win. Harry then says that he is more powerful then Voldemort. But we don't see it. We see him use his signature move and thats it. It's all he ever uses. It gets him through, sure, but he never shows any sort of power. Voldemort was at his weakest since 16. Any half decent wizard would've been able to kill him apart from the prophecy stating it must be Harry. There's no payoff for all of his learning throughout the books. Even Bellatrix Vs Molly shows off the characters skill and power better then the ""Duel"" between Harry and Voldemort",0
"What literary character do you most identify with?What passages about this character have given you the most insight into your own life or identity? I don't typically attach myself to characters, but I've always enjoyed choosing a character at the beginning of a book as ""my"" character and paying particular attention to that character's development.

When I began reading Tolstoy's War and Peace, I chose Prince Andrei. Following a really meaningful and candid conversation with my professor, who stated that the early characterization Prince Andrei reminded him of himself when he was young, I began to feel a special affinity for this character. 

I saw in Andrei all of my own flaws and shortcomings. I also felt that many of his frustrations reflected my own. At the time, I had no idea how to orient myself morally and, in my own depression and disillusionment, began to hate the people around me. Andrei's journey changed me. Every time I finished a chapter about him, I found myself wishing that I had read it the week before. Everything Tolstoy wrote about this character was so relevant and instructive to me. I had never experienced anything like it. My connection to this work and to Andrei has changed my outlook on life and have unburdened me greatly.

I'd love, with that being said, to hear of any characters that you felt a special kinship with. Who is your Andrei? If you're familiar with W&P, did you relate to him or any of the other main characters? Let me know!

Edit to add a passage about Andrei (Edited to remove any possible spoilers, of course),
""Yes, here, in this woods, was that oak that I agreed with,"" thought Prince Andrei. ""But where is it?"" he thought again, looking at the left side of the road, and, not knowing it himself, not recognizing it, he admired the very oak he was looking for. The old oak, quite transformed, spreading out a canopy of juicy, dark greenery, basked, barely swaying, in the rays of the evening sun. Of the gnarled fingers, the scars, the old grief and mistrust--nothing could be seen.
--
No, life isn't over at the age of thirty-one,"" Prince Andrei suddenly decided definitively, immutably.""It's not enough that I know all that's in me, everyone else must know it, too. Everyone must know me, so that my life is not only for myself; so that they don't live independently of my life, but so that it is reflected in everyone, and they all live together with me!""",1

"Back Home by Michelle Magorian a tween historical fiction book about culture shock I'm of two minds about giving this book as a gift. The main character is a child of roughly 11, just returned to England at the end of WWII after four years in the US. The book is an amazing and sometimes funny depiction of the differences between US and UK culture along with war time experiences like rationing and blackout curtains. They eat cake with no sugar and of course the main character doesn't like it. 

However, much of what the book portrays is depressing and bleak. Everything is (I assume) accurate to the period including a boarding school with rules against talking in the hallways and talking to children of the opposite gender, a father who doesn't like children and believes women shouldn't work outside of the home, physical discipline etc. The mother works as a mechanic for the war effort so that creates interesting conflict but I'm torn whether I want to share these realities with my young relative. 

I wonder what your experiences have been with good depictions of culture shock in books for tweens and what your thoughts are. My relative has read Anne Frank's diary so it's not as if she is totally sheltered, but I'm torn about whether to get her this as something to read for fun. What are your thoughts?",1

It is cleverly written, not revealing too much but having sub stories linking back to the main thing in one or two chapters. It is quite long and I think worth the read. It is written by 2 authors: John Connelly and Jennifer Ridyard. Its about forbidden love, rebellion, politic schemes and an alien race that is intelligent.",1
"Jacqueline Wilson - children's must-read I just saw a post on books that shaped you as a child and I was surprised that no one said Jacqueline Wilson and I wondered if it's because she's a UK author and not well known in America?

At one point pretty much every child in the UK knew of the Tracy Beaker TV series that's based on 2(+?) books by Wilson about a kid growing up in a children's care home. 

It isn't an overstatement to say Jacqueline Wilson shaped my view of social issues, poverty and family dynamics. Her books are about honestly quite depressing topics (neglect, divorce, bullying, isolation, poverty, bereavement) but the stories are told with such warmth, empathy and humour that I never felt upset by reading her books - I simply wanted to read more.

I think her books are generally aimed at ages 8-15 - some are definitely only suitable for 11/12+

Her books are imprinted on my brain and I would highly recommend them.

The ones that I still think about most are:
• _the bed and breakfast star_ (about a girl and her mum forced to live in a government-funded hotel after being made homeless)
• _the illustrated mum_ (girl with mum who has mental health difficulties)
• _the suitcase kid_ (divorce)
• _diamond girls_ (poverty, unstable family dynamics)
• _sleepovers_ and _best friends_ (both about friendship)

"Finished reading Pickwick Papers. It certainly took more time than I expected. I think I have been reading it for a few weeks by now. I particularly struggled with the section about legal trouble and prison. The rest of the story was so light hearted and easy going. But then I got hit by the pile of bricks.

Regardless, I am glad to have overcome my resistance and finished the book.

Supposedly, this is the ""not so great"" work of Dickens. Which makes me wonder what his master pieces are like. I hope the grim dark tone is not the deciding factor.

Oh and vocabulary. It is hard to believe that he could write such heavy language in his early(?) twenties. Half way through, my dictionary app pulled an update and trashed the history. Now I don't have access to more than half the words I had to look up. In the future, I should write unfamiliar words on a paper notebook.

Thanks for listening to my ramblings. Bye!",0
"Saddest book you’ve ever read? For me, it’s Forbidden by Tabitha Suzuma. As the titles implies, it’s about a forbidden relationship between two siblings. Now before you bash me for openly crying about a book with literal INCEST in it, let me explain my reasoning without spoiling it. 

I first read this book when I was 18, feeling emotionally trapped as I myself felt I was having forbidden feelings for a friend of mine, who was in a long distance relationship. He knew about my feelings quite easily as I turned a scarlet red when I was around him sometimes. He didn’t mind as he knew I wouldn’t do anything dumb and thought it was cute. I would write poems to cope but I felt like I needed something different. 

I looked up books with forbidden romances and Forbidden by Tabitha Suzuma popped up. I was allured by it’s cherry red cover with a chained heart surrounding the title. I looked up the synopsis and as curious by the content. Even before this I was fascinated by taboo relationships in shows and movies as I questioned: 

“What lead to this decision?” “Why do the characters crave what/who they can’t have?” “What in their life caused them to think this ok in the first place?” 

And considering this was the first book I’ve seen containing the topic of incest in general, I was intrigued. (This was before I discovered VC Andrews.) 
Mind you, I’d never support this in real life, as it is gross, it’s still interesting to be in a characters mind when they are questioning their morality, especially in a fiction novel. 

I decided to order a hardcover of the book off eBay and slowly read it for a few weeks. What I didn’t expect was to fall in love as well as sympathize with the two main characters like I did. The way the story was told and the events leading up to the relationship oddly made sense. I could feel the characters pain and dependence on one another. They knew their feelings were wrong but they also acknowledged how they would be broken without each other at the same time. 
And what happened at the end of the novel caused me to cry like a rainforest, which was rare for me. To this day it’s still the only book to make me cry at all. I even considered it my favorite book for awhile. 

And if you’re wondering about the guy I had feelings for, he and I are still close friends. Fine by me.",1
"My biggest problem with Where the Crawdad’s Sing Spoilers for those who haven’t read the book, I will be referencing the ending.

I just watched the movie for this book and I thought it was overall an okay adaptation and the scenes for the most part seemed to hit the high notes of the book.

That being said, I still have the same issue with the ending of the book as the movie.

I don’t believe the book should’ve ended with a definitive verdict that Kya killed Chase. I understand it was set up and that’s it’s seen as a part of nature in the marsh and that she was smart about how she planned it out. But that being said, it should’ve ended after the courtroom where the lawyer gave his monologue about “the Marsh Girl.” They could’ve still had the “not guilty” verdict but I wanted it to be ambiguous. That way you could have people try to figure out their own interpretation of the ending. Does the marsh girl of these tall tales exist who would be capable of killing one of the town’s respected members? Or was she misjudged her whole life and abandoned and set up by a town that’s had no love for her?

I don’t know, I just feel like it would be more impactful if we didn’t know that she truly killed her and it was up to the audience/ jury to decide.",1
"The Silent Patient shouldn't have been this much polemical. Finished TSP sometime back and found online that the feedback the series received is just... WOW! Unsure if this is the outcome Alex Michaelides wanted but hey at least it's a feat on its own terms.   


Before recontextualization, TSP is a story about a psychotherapist whose curiosity has led him to treat this mysterious patient who murdered her husband for an unknown reason. He goes from person to person, relative to relative, to find out the reason why she murdered her husband.   


BOOM! The twist reshapes the perspective. Now TSP is a story about a psychotherapist who doesn't necessarily show up to treat his patient, he is there to find out who she has shared their little history with. He goes from person to person, relative to relative, to find out who knows the truth and how much.   


In retrospect, the book had really good takeaways in terms of identification, empathy, and boundaries.  This statement will get a lot of hate but it's respectable how the book chooses not to spoonfeed certain stuff as doing so might potentially make the reader feel their intelligence is being insulted. As snow symbolizes freedom and acceptance in the book, you could totally feel for the MC when in the end it snows.  


A hot take, maybe, but I'd say it's a great book and will be a subject of debate for a long, long time.",1
"If you enjoy Golden Age mystery fiction, and have never tried Japanese shin honkaku, I highly recommend giving it a try I made this post after seeing a book suggestion asking about Japanese literature because I know that not a lot of readers know about [Japanese detective fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_detective_fiction) or how it's such a huge market there right now. 

**Introduction and Short History**

The Golden Age of Detective Fiction was an era of classic murder mystery novels of similar patterns and styles, predominantly in the 1920s and 1930s (some famous names of this era include Agatha Christie, John Dickson Carr, Ellery Queen, and more).

When this spread to Japan in the 1920s, it created a detective fiction genre (or honkaku), and Edogawa Rampo is generally considered the first modern Japanese mystery writer of this. The popularity of this later waned in the 1950s because mysteries started to focus more on social realism.

Recently, starting in the 1980s, a movement called shin honkaku has started, which is basically the successor to honkaku and is essentially Japan's modern day version of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. It is still ongoing with many award-winning novels still releasing to this day.

**What does shin honkaku focus on?**

I'd say the two greatest aspects of shin honkaku mysteries are:

- fair play clues that are all available to the reader. It's treated as an intellectual game between reader and writer, and the reader wins if they can deduce who it is, while the author wins if they can outwit the reader.

-  carefully constructed puzzle mysteries, including many ""locked room"" murders. (AKA a murder where the deceased is locked in a room with the key inside via a clever trick, or some variation thereof.)

There's other aspects such as adherence to ""Van Dine's Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories"", sometimes a Challenge to the Reader in the spirit of Ellery Queen's novels, and sometimes references to mysteries of the past. (For example, the Decagon House Murders has its characters nicknamed after mystery authors.)

**How do I read this if it's Japanese?**

From my research, there's two English publishers to check out for Japanese honkaku:

- Locked Room International (https://www.mylri.com/books/) - they focus on ""impossible crimes"" as their namesake implies. Many honkaku fit this with their locked room murders, so they've brought many acclaimed titles over from Japan.

- Pushkin Press (https://pushkinpress.com/all-books/pushkin-vertigo/japanese-crime/) - they have a section focused on Japanese crime fiction and are the next best publisher for this stuff after LRI.

**What are some suggestions to read?**

These are some of my personal suggestions. Feel free to add your own below!

- “[Death Among the Undead](https://www.lockedroominternational.com/books/death-among-the-undead-by-masahiro-imamura/)” by Masahiro Imamura from LRI is the only novel ever to have achieved first place in all four major annual mystery fiction rankings in Japan, and it's even received both a manga and movie adaptation. The plot combines a zombie outbreak and multiple impossible murders (the zombies have well defined rules, so it is a fair play solvable mystery).

- ""[Decagon House Murders](https://www.mylri.com/books/the-decagon-house-murders-by-yukito-ayatsuji/)"" by Yukito Ayatsuji from both LRI/Pushkin is basically the Japanese version of ""And Then There Were None"" but done better and is what essentially launched the shin honkaku movement. A university mystery club decide to visit an island where a murder happened before and start getting picked off one by one.

- ""[The Moai Island Puzzle](https://www.mylri.com/books/the-moai-island-puzzle-by-alice-arisugawa/)"" by Alice Arisugawa from LRI features a brilliant locked room murder, a dying message, and an extremely satisfying chain of deduction leading to the culprit. It focuses on three students who travel to an island filled with moai statues. Their goal is to find a hidden treasure, but several murders—including one impossible–occur before it can be located.

**tl;dr** If you like Golden Age Mystery Fiction, shin honkaku is the modern day Japanese version of it, and I strongly recommend trying out some of their underrated gems.",1
"The Butterfly Garden by Dot Hutchison I started this book at 11pm last night and read through the night, finishing it at 6am. It's been years since I did this! 

Can't say it was a masterpiece, but it was certainly compelling reading. 

For those who have read the book, can you help me out with the ending please? Maybe because I'd read all night, but I can't for the life of me figure out the ending. I don't know how to use the black out for spoilers, sorry, so I've put my more specific question waaaay down the bottom of this post.

When they were at the hospital, why was it suddenly known that Sophia was the escaped butterfly? Was this subtly suggested earlier in the book and I missed it? Did Inara deliberately put herself into the garden? If so, why and how was this linked to Sophia?",1
"What series had the most impact on you as a kid? I first read the original Old Kingdom series (Sabriel, Lirael, Abhorsen) by Garth Nix when I was in elementary school. It's been 20+ years since then and I re-read it every year or so. It never gets old and it's the only 'world' that I can totally lose myself in. I learned a lot of interesting new words from it. I connected so strongly to the main characters they became heroes to me.

What series means the most to you? What do you feel (or not feel) when reading it?",1
"Ideology and Imagining Death in Sebastian Junger's The Perfect Storm >""I had pictures of what happened, images: Bobby and Sully and Murph just bug-eyed, knowing this is the final moment, looking at each other and this jug of booze goin' around real fast because they're tryin' to numb themselves out, and then Bobby goes flyin' and Sully goes under. But what was the final moment? What was the final, final thing?""

*The Perfect Storm* by Sebastian Junger, page 168

The above quotation is the response of Christina Cotter, the girlfriend of one of the men on board the *Andrea Gail* during the ""perfect storm"" from which the book derives its title\*,\* to the death of her boyfriend Bobby Shatford. In it, we find an ordinary woman's attempt to grapple with the loss of a loved one to the senseless violence of a natural disaster.

Anybody who has experienced the loss of a loved one to violence will recognize the gesture, the desire to pull into visibility to last moments of the deceased. Like Christina, we might imagine the event in the third-person, as though we were there and somehow immune to the violence, giving our attention wholly to the loved one with no thought of ourselves. This is, in a sense, a fantasy: the myth of a passive spectator. Like a kind of guardian angel, we can watch over the beloved and accompany them through the final trial of their lives.

More difficult to imagine the violence in the first-person. Even if we have experienced violence in the past, we can't imagine what it might feel like for *another person* to endure it. Some people describe their violent recollections as terrifying; Ernie Hazard, another victim of shipwreck in *The Perfect Storm* describes his own close call with death as ""business-like."" Impossible to know with which of these extremes—or where in the middle—our loved one's experience correlates.

But, of course, we run up against the wall of ""the final, final thing.""

I take *The Perfect Storm* to be a book concerned with speculating about death: both how death happens and what death means. Since anyone who has read the book jacket knows that the crew of the *Andrea Gail* ""disappeared without a trace,"" even the most ordinary passages of the book come to take on a doomed aspect. Our imagination of death begins with a recounting of the banal details of life. We know how the story ends; the question is how we get there.

I think I know why Christina Cotter has a vested interest in imagining the details of her boyfriend's death. I take it to be a kind of trauma response. She wants to mentally recreate a moment in her boyfriend's life so that, the fantasy goes, she can empathize and connect with him. The experience of doing so is, strictly speaking, horrific; we are rarely comforted by our imagination of death. Christina's own attempt at the act only leads her to a question, ""What was the final, final thing?"" because that is where her imagination fails. She can imagine everything up until death itself. What she really wants, I suspect, might be to go past death so that she can still be with her boyfriend wherever he is now (if, indeed, one believes that he is anywhere at all).

Given that *The Perfect Storm* dedicates an entire chapter (""The Zero-Moment Point"") to exhaustively imagining the deaths of the six men who perished aboard the *Andrea Gail,* down to describing, biologically, what is happening to their bodies during the different stages of drowning, I take it that Christina is not alone in wanting to imagine the death of her boyfriend. Reading generously, I suspect that Junger's motivation is not to luridly dramatize those deaths for the purposes of entertainment, but rather to try, in some small way, to understand the crew's suffering, the senselessness of their deaths.

He hedges his prose with what ""could have"" happened, rather than trying to write the definitive version of events. Even his descriptions of drowning are delivered in a clinical, rather than a sensationalist, tone. He speaks of what ""the body"" does, abstractly, as it drowns. This is ideology. Rather than the failure of the imagination that Christina experiences, Junger replaces the uncertainty of how the individual experiences death with a surrogate: what happens, mechanically, as the body shuts down. In Junger's version, the ""final, final thing"" reads:

>The electrical activity in their brain gets weaker and weaker until, after fifteen or twenty minutes, it ceases all together.

*The Perfect Storm* by Sebastian Junger, page 146

But this is only the pretense of knowledge, a substitute for the information that Christina Cotter tries to summon when she imagines the crew's final moments. However, I take the substitution to be a practical one: Junger is no more capable of imagining their deaths than Christina is. (And, indeed, maybe less so, since she actually knew the men.) And yet, even though the fascination is morbid, there is something about the clinical description that appeals to the reader. It offers an abstracted portrait of the deaths of six men—and promises that our own death, when it comes, will be, in some small way, knowable.",1
"""Miss Ulysses from Puka-Puka"" is my new favorite book I just had the vacation of a lifetime in the Cook Islands🇨🇰 I sailed the south seas with a friend named Florence Johnny Frisbee. 

Pals, in my journey reading around the world this is so far the best book yet. It might be the best book I have ever read. Go out and buy it and read it for yourselves. What a novel! 

The book is ""Miss Ulysses from Puka-Puka"". It is an autobiography account of the life of the ingenious woman, Johnny Frisbee. She wrote this epic novel at the young age of 12-14 back in 1947! And she is still alive today at the age of 90! And this book was the first ever book published by a pacific island woman. 

Johnny's mother Nga is a native Pacific islander from Puka-Puka. Her father, Robert, is an American author who has made the south seas his home. Johnny is their second child of five. 

What do I love so much about this book? Its funny and its well written. 

This book provides a unique perspective of a time when the South Seas islands were becoming forever changed. The period right before and during World War Two. That perspective is unique as it is through the the eyes of a BRILLIANT, indigenous young woman. It is filled with so many fun and interesting anecdotes about pacific island life. It is a fast paced read that is well packed with information. 

It shows a very special bond between a father and his children. It shows a strong male role model, and thoughtful intentional love and joy filled parenting from a single father that i dont believe was so common at the time it was written. 

Im not going to give away too much if the book, but their mother dies early on and the kids, against their relatives wishes stay with their father. With him they live a life of sailing and adventure. They get marooned on an island and stuck in a hurricane. True story! 
 
This epic memoire of adolescence is just so well written - which i was not expecting by a 14 year old. The book was edited by her father, and so the flawlessness could be helped by his hand, but I believe the most of the work is Johnny's and not her fathers. The preface, which was written by her father says ""I hope you will forgive the all too evident signs if the meddling middle-aged father"". Sir, you are forgiven. 

The book is written in part from Johnnys diaries, which were written in English, Rarotongan, and Puka-Pukan. Her father helped translate the Polynesian languages into english. 

Go, get this book now and let me know if you enjoyed it as much as I did. Johnny and her family are an inspiration of strength, character, love, humor and assiduousness. I will use this book as an example of the kind of woman I strive to and I will use it as a reminder of good parenting (although unorthodox). I will treasure my memory of this book for many years to come. 

🛶Thank you for joining me on my trip around the world via book. 19 down, 176(ish) to go. 🌏",1
"Cormac Mccarthy’s The Passenger was very good 👍 First time poster here. I’ve just finished reading Cormac Mccarthy’s new novel The Passenger and I can’t believe how this guy never misses. The book grabbed me from the start from the first sequence: Alicia, the protagonist’s sister, arguing with figments of her imagination, perhaps delusions brought on by her schizophrenia. 

There’s a lot of contrast between Alicia’s story and that of her brother. Bobby Western’s story can be most closely situated next to McCarthy’s No Country for Old Men with its cat and mouse narrative and grizzled men that wax poetic. 

I found the book to be pretty approachable, though it seemed to turn into a different story by the end. This is pretty standard for McCarthy, though, so I never expected him to connect certain plot related threads. 

So, have you guys read it and did you enjoy it?",1
"Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell I decided to annotate a book for my friend for a Christmas present, I chose Fangirl. While I am only on page 162 so far I have noticed a lot of things that put me off the book. Imo the main character (Cath) is very unlikeable.

- She is very antisocial, which wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that she is constantly sh*tting on everyone else for going out and having fun 

- She is really rude to literally everyone for no reason whatsoever, yet again could be social anxiety but she insults peoples physical appearance multiple times during the book (I remember one particular instance where she commented on her roommates body and basically said nobody wants to look like her) 

- She very much gives of I'm not like other girls energy 


-I'm not gonna lie her fan fiction is awful, at the end of every chapter a small bit of fan fiction is included which I find incredibly boring to read and annotate, I don't mind the small sections at the end that much except at one point Levi asks her to read him some of her fan fiction, which she does. The fan fiction drags on for ages, literally 10 pages of her reading another book with no context to the plot or anything 
and we're expected to get invested in it. I literally left my friend a post it note saying it was too boring to annotate and the page where she stopped reading the fan fiction

"A penny for some thoughts on The Inheritance Games Trilogy? So I just read the first book of The Inheritance Games. I'm not sure if I should read the other two. Not sure if maybe I'm just not the intended age group? (Not a teenager). I found the characters quite bland and generically written. The teenagers didn't really feel like teenagers either. The main girl Avery starts out with a lot of promise but I feel like she loses a lot of her personality in favor of romantic interests. I found myself questioning her bad decisions a LOT. The mystery was interesting enough to keep me reading though.

Also I barely tolerated the censored swearing. I feel like there has to be a better way to censor swearing if you don't want it in your YA novel.

If anyone else has read this series, what did you think, does it get any better? Do they flesh out the characters some? Is it worth continuing? Or should I just google the ending and move on?",0
"Do you think that critically acclaimed writers put as much thought into literary analysis as their critiques do postmortem? I just read The Snows of Kilimanjaro and grew to appreciate how Hemingway places greater meaning between the lines, but reading more analysis pieces makes me wonder if there’s too much analysis into classics sometimes.

What if setting and characters are pictured from how a writer feels on instinct instead of it being a part of a greater theme of analysis? 

Could just be me, but sometimes I feel like writing essays on paragraphs out of short stories can take some of its inherent value out of the literary piece.",1
"A Thousand Splendid Suns: Khaled Hosseini was born to be a writer Khalid Hosseini outdoes himself in his second novel A Thousand Splendid Sons. While through Kite Runner Hosseini establishes himself as master storyteller, through this novel he is able to craft an even more heart rendering story, with more nuance and character building than before.

The novel revolves around two protagonists Marian and Lala, born 20 years apart, with vastly different upbringings, who somehow find themselves together in the face of a bloody war, an oppressive ruling regime and a single violent patriach. 

Hosseini spends a great deal in fleshing out the two main characters and the troubles they face. You are left wondering who to feel more sympathy for. While a fictional story, it is more in touch with historical events and takes the reader through all the tumultous events that took place during the last few decades of the 20th century in Afghanistan. 

The brutality of the war is even more pronounced in this book. With nothing left to the imagination of reader, Hosseini paints the war ravaged Afganistan as is, from the rockets falling around to the morality police doling out harsh punishments. Despite all the harsh atmosphere of Afganistan at the time, it is the domestic suffering that is the most vicious. But unlike the Kite Runner, there is no respite for the characters here. They are ordained to a life of misery and helplessness. 

I have read many novels but a short few have been as engaging and as heart rendering as this one. Hosseini was born to be a writer.",1
"Virginia Woolf's Short Stories is a definitive segway into the Stream of Consciousnes genre. Specifically ""Mark on The Wall"".

Woolf was a titan. She paved the way for feminist modernist literature, pioneered Stream of Consciousnes as a narrative mode in fiction, and she created her own style with it that both celebrated and challenged the english language and also one's psyche. 

She was also famous for pulling no punches when writing about famous works of literature  - She has an iconic review in which she blasts Ulyesses and save for David Copperfield, she *hated* the work of Dickens.

When I thought about where to start with Woolf, I dived into Mrs. Dalloway. Now, don't get me wrong. It's a spectacular work of heartache, mental health, Post- War ptsd  and an intricate analysis into the subconscious of a character. It's a masterpiece, let's be honest. 

But in my opinion, her short stories is a far better ease not just into her own daunting yet rewarding body of work, but a great helping transition into the stream of consciousness genre in general.

If you are hoping to one day dive into Faulkner or Kerouac, or even Joyce, Then I'd strongly recommend Virginia Woolf's 'The Mark On the Wall'. It is a FP story about a woman sitting on a sofa, smoking a cigarette and suddenly she see's a mark on the wall. What *is* that mark on the wall? she wonders. Maybe its this, maybe it's that, but the mark itself becomes a vessel into her own complicated train of thought. 

She ruminates about British politics, religion, relationships and childhood. Basically all the main wonders of the human condition condensed into a perfectly paced short story. And yes, the Mark is revealed by the end.

And it's this story, for me, that clicks with you. And you fully understand not only Woolf's style, but the genre as a whole. Even though Stream of Consciousness is dense by default, This particular story is definitely one of Woolf's most accessible stories. It's one of those stories that make you go ""Ohhhhhh! I see! That's amazing now!""

Edit: I should have said Narrative Mode instead of Genre, but I choose to keep the word for better understanding and flow. Also, I did reupload this post because I messed up the title.",1
"Where the crawdaws sing This might be a bit late, but however...so, the book was super hyped in Germany two years ago. People said it was the best book they ever read, it had a beautiful language, it was thrilling. I got it for my birthday that year and it was somehow disappointed and...angry? To the language: wow, the author knows how to use methaphors and uses the nature for that, goos Job, but nothing extraordanary. The plot was interesting, but not super thrilling, at least to me.

"I just read “IT” by Stephen King for the first time. First off, previous to this year, I’ve never been a big reader. The largest book I ever read before this year was an autobiography sitting at around 450 pages. Also for context, I have had a desire to read this book for many, many years. So because of that, I strayed from watching the TV and movie adaptions. So I’m lucky enough to have gone into this reading 100% fresh, outside the few key things that I wasn’t able to completely hide from like the basic facts about Pennywise in the sewer for example.

When I realized that IT by Stephen King needed to be added to my “Must Read Before I Die” list, I was honestly a little nervous. The size of the book is what I would imagine makes the average person pass on tackling it. Sitting a little over 1,100 pages I can truthfully say…man, I understand. 

It took me a little less than a month to read. But I am beyond grateful I decided to stick with it. Regardless of size.

I’m not someone who gets scared easily by media like books and movies. But the way Pennywise is written is truly terrifying. The lore around him mentioned and built throughout the book has some moments that made me feel unsettled. But the actual interactions with him creeped me out super hard. I went in downplaying the horror. That was silly of me.

I think this book was a writing master class. I also have more than enough reason to confidently believe this book will stand the test of time and will very likely be considered King’s “legacy.”

Sometimes when it comes to books that are extremely famous, I walk away a little disappointed. Hype makes me a hard critic because the bar is raised super high automatically. IT is a book that I will praise until the end. It makes complete sense why it is culturally relevant and still having adaptions made decades later.

My next “huge book of the year” will be The Stand. I know that both The Stand and IT are considered King’s very best. So I think it makes sense to naturally read The Stand when I’m ready for another large book to dive into.

"I just finished The Moviegoer and a great novel that reminds me of Donna Tartt. Author Walter Percy lived in New Orleans among other places. I was unprepared for how good this book is. His portrayal of a southern family is light but deep in its observations. The main character, Binx, is a soulseaching amoral businessman. 

But the language and descriptions bring back the 1960's New Orleans that I remember as well as the times. For those who read The Little Friend, this novel is completely different yet has a similar tone. The book has been called by some writers the first contemporary american novel. 

I'm interested in the opinions of others who have read it and especially those who might have been reminded of Donna Tartt. Or maybe I'm the only one. My copy has an afterword by Paul Elie which is worth reading.",1
"Bleak House  

I am sorry for bringing this up for the umpteenth time in this group. I just finished Dickens' Bleak House and found it one of the hardest books I have ever read. English isn't my first language, but I am somewhat competent in it and got through Hard Times and David Copperfield fairly okay.

I am glad I powered through it as I think it is ultimately rewarding and the threads sort of come together at the end. Having said that, I am sure quite a lot of it was lost on me. I found the language outside of ""Esther's Narrative"" quite hard and was generally quite thrown by the proliferation of characters. Although, as I say, a lot was lost on me, I wonder if it is reasonable to speculate that the author may have exaggerated with the number of characters. No doubt these are basic thoughts, but I thought I'd share them.

1984 is a novel published in 1949, it was written by ""Eric Arthur Blair"" better known as his pet name ""George Orwell"". George Orwell was a novelist, journalist, essayist, and critic, he's best known for his novels Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. 1984 is widely known and praised. And honestly, it did not just live up to my expectations but also exceed them.   


""The big brother is watching""  


This novel is set in a dystopian future where the world is turned into three super-states. Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia. And there is a totalitarian rule across all three super-states. Winston smith is the main protagonist of the book. He lives in Oceania. It is ruled by the party. Almost everywhere there are telescreens and mics which are used to watch people. Society has been divided into three castes. The inner party, the outer party, and lastly the proles. The party controls everything, from what to produce to what to think. They have introduced a new language named ""newspeak"" which has reduced the words in English, which is known as ""Oldspeak"". There is nothing that goes unnoticed by the party. The big brother has eyes everywhere. The party controls the past, present, and future. Winston is an outer party member, who works in the Ministry of Truth. Where he rewrites history according to the party and its needs. Winston thinks of destroying the party and wants to live the golden past. But there is no golden past according to the party. One day he meets a person named Obrien, whom he thinks is a member of the brotherhood! He also meets Julia who was in love with him. Love was seen as a crime at the party. But to Winston, it was a revolution!  


“Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have   
rebelled they cannot become conscious.”  


The book tells a story that is no longer in a dystopia. Many aspects of this book can be seen even in today's modern society, especially with the government. This book isn't just normal fiction no it's far more than that. This book says a lot about society and how we are caged inside the manipulative world. This book talks about so many aspects of life such as Human behavior, Freedom, the caste system, Manipulation, hope, love, hatred, how rulers can suppress the thought of people, Betrayal, and many more.   


“But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.”  


It is amazing how a limited usage of language can control people's thoughts. How falsification of history can alter human lives. How power can make people do atrocities. In honesty, to fully comprehend this book one must read it multiple times. I have a firm belief that if I reread this again in a year or two, I will understand more. The book can change your perspective on society. It will make you question the things that are happening right now.  


“We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.”  


The book felt magnificent to me. It also widened my overall perspective of society. The first part of the book was a slow build-up toward the wider philosophy. The second part took a turn. Made it into a love story which a lot of stories to tell, a beacon of hope in the darkness. The third part takes a dark turn, where I believe the whole book makes its premises clear. It's not an ending you would expect from books. Though I would say I was lost at the beginning of part two. It felt a bit disjointed to me for some reason.  


“In the face of pain, there are no heroes.”  


This book has inspired so many movies, games, books, series, and whatnot. The famous comic ""V for Vendetta"" was also inspired by this. Not to mention countless games which were inspired by Orwell's book. The historical impact of this book is truly amazing. I would suggest this book to everyone, but not everyone will grasp the basis of this book in one reading. I will be looking forward to reading this book in the future again! In the meantime will read aminal farm soon.   


In conclusion, I will say this is a must-read. A solid 10 out of 10.

"Three Ten AM ( 3:10 AM) by Nick Pirog review  Name of the book: Three Ten AM ( 3:10 AM)  
Writer: Nick Pirog  


3:10 am is the second book in the ""Henry Bins"" series. Its event takes place after six months after the events of the first book. I liked the first book, So started this one right after the first book. Heard that this was better than the first book.

Henry finally gets information about his Mother who left him when he was just six years old. But his mother is now dead! She was murdered! Her body was discovered near his house. And he's trying to figure out why she was killed. 

About the storytelling, this was fun but was a bit too weird. The way henry found the clues were too simple. This made it somewhat of a generic book. However in the end it kinda gets all things cleared but still it could've been much better. This book didn't make much sense to me during the first half. But I enjoyed reading the book. 

The characters are the same as in the previous book. With some new characters. Just like in the previous book, loved the cat. The interaction between henry and lussie was amazing and hilarious. Others were Okey.

Will recommend this to those who liked the first book very much. Haven't read or bought the third book, is it any good?

  
Anyway my rating of the book:  
7/10  


Seemed a bit overrated to me.",1
"Three AM ( 3:00 AM ) by Nick Pirog review  “Three in the morning must be the quietest time of the day. Even the nocturnal night people have turned in and the crazy, morning folk are still tucked away.”  


Book Name: Three AM ( 3:00 AM )  
written by Nick Pirog  


What would happen if you had only one hour every day?  
Three AM is a murder mystery/thriller book written by Nick Pirog. The main protagonist is Henry Bins. Who has a medical condition named after him, henry bins. It is a medical condition where one stays awake for only one hour and sleeps the rest. Henry only stays awake for one hour, which usually starts at three am and ends at four am. Hence the name of the book is three am. One day Henry was getting ready to sleep as it was close to four am but suddenly hears a screaming voice of a girl, he goes to the window and sees the president of America in his neighborhood before he could do anything he falls asleep and woke up the next night. After that, he went to the house where he heard the scream last night and finds a body of a girl. Did the president of America kill this girl? this one night changes the aspect of henry's life to a great extent.  


How was the book? Honestly, I enjoyed the book. It was short so finished it within a day.  The story was fine, a bit weird but fun nonetheless. The book provides a good time for the reader. It has some elements of thriller, suspense, and a bit of a love story. It's fast pace so if you like to have a read on a weekend this book will be perfect. The story wasn't over the top nor was it underdeveloped, it was balanced. My favorite parts were with the cat. Which for some reason was acting like a dog. but whatever, it was really a fun read.

In conclusion, I would say this book is both fun and suspenseful. Not the best thriller or murder mystery book nor is average. Will rate it somewhere between   
7.5-8 out of 10.  


Will definitely recommend this book, one can read it within a day or so.",1
"Do sex scenes ruin books for you? I just finished reading The Power of the Dog by Don Winslow. It was an absolutely fantastic book but towards the end 2 characters have a sex scene. 

It made sense for them to have a sex scene but the wording he used like licking sweat off her lips and neck and ""gently rubs her bud"" just felt cringey to me. All I could think about it Don sitting there writing out this sex secene.",1
"Who are some of your favorite ""forgotten writers""? I see Project Gutenberg as a godsend. During the pandemic I spent a lot of time just looking up various books from the 16th century onwards, with some help of Wikipedia of course. 

This lead to a few reading lists and discovery of writers that I think are largely forgotten today, some of those writers include:

Elinor Wylie, had an very interesting life, was both an actress and writer, her book of poetry, Nets to Catch Wind took my breath away.

Claire de Duras, French writer from the 18th and 19th century, loved her novella Ourika

C.C. MacApp, American Sci Fi writer, largely active after WW2, His short story All That Earthly Remains is one of my favorite thrillers.

C.L. Moore, also an American Sci Fi writer, she was one of the first female sci fi writers who earned a living writing this genre, her novella Tree of Life has some of the most pleasing prose I have ever read.

Matthew Gregory Lewis, 19th century novelist, he wrote Monk which is a brilliant gothic novel about a corrupt priest. The book itself reads like the best telenovela of all time.

What are some of your favorite writers that you think should be more widely read?",1
"Like Water For Chocolate ending??? why 

I just finished this book an hour ago and I’m still reeling. I love it, I loved it, I couldn’t put it down once I started reading it and I’m heartbroken at the ending. 

Why on EARTH would >!she choose Pedro? I think that Esquivel’s reveal about it being Esperanza and Alex’s wedding is brilliant, and it totally got me. But why, after everything with Pedro, would she choose him? I feel like John was the only main character (aside from Nacha and Chencha) to treat her as an equal, and who essentially offered her freedom. Not that that means she has to choose him, but, Tita ending up with Pedro, combined with the epigraph (To table or to bed, you must come when you are called) makes it seem like Tita never had a choice. She was born in the kitchen, she was called by Pedro, and always obeyed, when in reality her character was so much more than that.!<

Reading this for the first time, and being relatively young, means I’m coming in with a fairly naïve view about love. But, really? Am I missing something? What do you guys think?",1
"Demon Copperhead… Loved it. What did everyone else think? I’ve been dragging my feet getting to Demon Copperhead, because I’m a HUGE Dickens fan, and I just couldn’t imagine myself liking a reimagining of a Dickens story. But I was wrong. Aside from a few small details, I thoroughly enjoyed Demon Copperhead, and finished it in under 24 hours (thank goodness I started on a weekend). What did everyone else think? What were your favorite and least favorite parts of the book?

I really appreciated the fact that while there were a lot of parallels between the stories, there were also differences enough that it wasn’t simply a “change the details, but the story stays exactly the same.” I loved the fact that it was largely true to David Copperfield but also authentically a story about a kid growing up in the late 90’s and early 00’s. 

One thing that did sort of irritate me is that I didn’t enjoy some of the references that seemed anachronistic… for example, when he first gets to Nashville, presumably in the late 90’s, and he mentions Carrie Underwood… whose first album came out in like 2005. 
And then later in the book, which we can assume is around 2004 based on other references… he AGAIN mentions Carrie Underwood in connection with Nashville. First of all… lots of people life in Nashville. It wasn’t like options were super limited. And I guess you could say, “well, he’s telling this afterward” etc etc… Okay, but most of the things in the story weren’t like that. Most of them stuck pretty close to the actual time that they would’ve been a thing if you match them up to actual definitive historical events. 
Another example is Survivor being mentioned I THINK before it would have been on air… but I can’t remember for sure if I am mistaken on that. 
Anyhow, I know there are at least two or three more little details like this that mostly just irritate me because they take me out of the story. It is one thing to say, “this eventually happened, but I’m getting ahead of myself etc etc…” and a whole different thing to be like, “it was 1943 in Los Angeles… where Brad Pitt lives.”

Anyhow, I know it is a minor issue, but in such a good book, it really detracts. Especially since you could like, google “was Carrie underwood a thing in the late 90’s?” And tbh this seems like a pretty small amount of research you would want an author to do.",1
"Young Mungo by Douglas Stewart I have just finished this book and enjoyed it.  I have not read Stewart's previous and debut novel, *Shuggie Bain* so this was my first of his novels.

For those who dinny ken, *Young Mungo*, like *Shuggie Bain*, is set in some of the most deprived areas in Glasgow (this is dust cover info so is nae a spoiler).  Apparently Stewart grew up in Glasgow, studied in England and now lives in America.

I grew up in Glasgow and still live here.  I've walked those very streets that Mungo walks; I've lived in those schemes.  What struck me was the prose which Stewart uses for his characters.  It felt jarring at times.  No Weegie in those schemes would say ""wasn't"" or ""isn't"" - it's ""wisnae"" or ""isnae"".  No-one in Scotland refers to ""heavy cream""; it's ""double cream"".  Similarly, a ""commissary"" and ""conniption"" are purely US words.

Don't get me wrong: the story, the foreboding, the tension in the book are all first class and I found it gripping and tragic.  However I feel that Stewart has spent too long away from Glasgow for his prose to sound authentically Glaswegian.  For those outside Scotland, maybe.  Mebbes aye, mebbes naw.

But for this Weegie, Stewart needs tae return tae his roots and spend some time back here afore writing another novel set in good al Glesga.

Are there any other Weegies or Scots here who've read it?   I'd love to hear your views!",1
"the inheritance games I just want a moment to flip the heck out over the book series I am currently yelling my way though(literally).

I am reading the the inheritance games books by Jennifer Lynn Barnes and I just can not deal with the absolute gem that is this book series.

This has got to be one of the most emotional roller-coaster books of all the books I have ever read. Now I can fully get a little emotional when reading a good book but up to date, I think I only ever had strong reaction to reading a book a handful of times. This book had me outright sitting up and not wanting to stop reading. To losing my mind at how book 1 ended. To sulking because I had to wait for the next book. To outright losing my shit over what just happened.

This is absolutely the best ever. I can not deal with how amazingly epically brilliant this is. I have literally had the time of my life figuring out the answers with the characters. I had absolutely wanted to faceplam so hard because I never would have guessed what something means. You always have an idea of what is happening but then ***BAM**** something happens that you didn't not see it coming or the character outsmarted even me as the reader.",1
"Thoughts on abandoning a book halfway through? What are your thoughts on quitting a book halfway through if it isn't turning out to be as engaging as you thought it would be? How many of you would see it through, and how many of you would just say, ""Life's too short,"" and move on?

I ask you this because I've come across too many books lately that I feel like I'm wasting my time on, and I can't figure out whether it's because I might be suffering from attention issues, or because I'm just choosing books I shouldn't be. 

I'm currently reading Where the Crawdads Sing, and it's just unending torment with every passing paragraph.

I also quit American Psycho halfway through because it wasn't able to retain my interest after a certain point. And that's a movie I actually enjoyed watching!

Does anybody else deal with this dilemma?",0
"Haunting of Hill House I just finished it yesterday and it's been on my mind since! I loved it so much. Jackson writing is so beautiful. I loved Eleanor's subtle descent into madness. The way Jackson describes anxiety and isolation is just top notch for me! A lot of the bad reviews on Goodreads are due to it not being scary, but I think they missed the point completely!",1
"I just finished the ""Fable"" series by Adrienne Young. Sorry this is so long. I'm trying to sort my feelings out about this series now that I just finished all the books. Would like anybody's thoughts on the ""Fable"" series by Adrienne Young. I tried not to write any spoilers in here. Just the premise of each book. 

 I absolutely loved the 1st book. I read it on my Kindle. Then I purchased the audio book and listened to it more than 3 more times while I was making art. I just I loved the world building and writing so much and the voice actors were enjoyable to listen to. I also couldn't find a book that sparked my interest as much. Its not a 'pirate book' as much as it is an interesting story of an interesting girl that happens to take place on the sea. 

I only listened to Namesake as an audio book, it was good not great. Left me wanting so much more. But the series jumps to ""The Last Legacy."" Is a different story completely but in the same universe with a few of the smaller characters from the other stories. I thought it was ok. I did listen to it more than once. I was confused about parts and struggled to put all the pieces together. Which I found a bit frustrating. Thus, listening more than once because I went back and read Fable and namesake again to see if I was missing things. I wish I had had made notes on the characters (for both Saint, Namesake and The Last Legacy.) Maybe that was the authors intent? To make the audience think about the where and the who and the why? I found it frustrating.

The forth book just came out, ""Saint,"" and it filled in most of the missing pieces from the other books. I'm not sure how I would feel about it as a stand alone novel and I'm debating on going back and reading the other 2 books again now that I have all the info. I'm a little disappointed at the slow drip of important information. I was very upset with the character Saint through most of the the first 2 books. I wish the Author could have given me SOMETHING more about him earlier in the series. 

Also, just a side note on the the audio book. It changed the pronunciation of one of Isolde's name in Saint. In book 1 and 2 its pronounced Is-ol'dee and the forth its pronounced Is-old. Yikes. Who wants to be named 'Is Old'? 

What did you think of the books and the revelations about Saint and Isolde in the last book? Do you think the Author told the story in the most effective and entertaining order? 

I almost feel like Saint should have come sooner in the series, rather than the last as a prequel. I know it would take some of the mystery aspect out but, damn, give me something to understand the premises. Throw me a fricken bone over here! lol.  I feel like the Last Legacy would have been more interesting having known just a bit more back story. I think I have to read them all again, back to back, just to decide if I liked the series. That's a little frustrating too. I suppose I must like the story enough to be willing to read them all again but, I've read the 1st 3 several times already!!! (Fable for enjoyment but namesake and last legacy, I had to read/listen to more than once just for clarity, not because I loved them so much). 

I really WANT to love the series. I keep telling myself ""If I just read it all again.... Maybe?"" 

Side note:
I tried to read another book by this author (""Spells for Forgetting"") and found it to be deliberately vague and didn't enjoy the rhetorical tools they used in the story telling. It was so very slow. So very, very slow. Felt disjointed. Trying to hard for suspense. Like, ""I see what you're trying to do and I don't like it."" Kinda thing. Like a, ""get to the fricken point already"" feeling the whole book. Major, deliberately clipped, story lines and when I got the whole picture of the specific stort line, it was anti climatic. It turned me off and I struggled to get through that book. Fable had a few parts like that but I was taken away by the world building it didn't bother me as much as it did in The Last Legacy.",1
"Reese Witherspoon Book Club: are any of the books she picks good? After reading 3 of the books she’s chosen, I now regard the little sticker on all of her picks as somewhat of a red flag. 

 The Last Mrs. Parish and was super let down by how underdeveloped the characters were. And, the ending wasn’t satisfying as I felt it could be. 

We Were Never Here by Andrea Bartz had potential, but the characters and the cringe of bringing up current pop culture references made me want to gag. The main character who is supposedly 30 actually says “Big Dick Energy” at one point. The context doesn’t matter to me. This is probably personal, but I hate when authors date themselves by incorporating current slang. Even besides that, I disliked this book because of its plot holes, annoying characters, and dumb MC. I could go on and on.

Where the Crawdads Sing also, in my opinion, was not good. No one wants to read poetry with a bunch of nasty descriptions of daily meals of mussels and grits with some murder in there somewhere.

ANYWAY. Yeah, I’ve only read 3 of Reese’s books. But I would think that at least one would be awesome. Are any of her others good, or does she just go for cheap bestsellers?

EDIT
People are so pressed! Yes, I get that it’s my taste, that’s what my saying a book is “not good” means. I’ve seen plenty of people on this sub who dislike the picks above. If you loved them, good for you. This probably isn’t the post for you to comment on. I didn’t even seek out Reese’s books. They just happened to be her picks. Now, I’m wary of her little sticker. Cheers!",0
"Finished ""My Policeman"" by Bethan Robert last night. I was in awe. (A Little spoiler alert)

Wow, I held my Kindle in the hands, staring at the last page, as I finished the novel.

It took my breath away. Three people, intertwined with each other by love, fear and jealousy. Jealousy is surly a green eyed monster. It destroyed love and friendship. 

>"">!You destroyed him!<."" 
>"">!We destroyed each other.""!< 

 I am so touched by the bravery of both the wife and the museum curator, and infurious at the cowardice of the policemen.

> >!Can you share me?!<

> >!If that's what it takes.!<

The theme of social injustice isn't unnoticed. The museum curator knows it is a fruitless forbidden love, yet he is helpless when it comes to his policeman.

> >!His eyes lit up when he saw my >card... He said he'd never been >to Brighton's most noble institution, even on a school trip! I invited him to visit the museum as my guest. He seemed interested... I haven't been able to stop thinking about him... He's handsome, yes. But there's something else. Innocence, combined with a curiosity... I'd like to draw him. But I wonder if he'd misunderstand... I'd almost forgotten that some people are still innocent.!<

Beautifully crafted, I love this book. The characters are three dimensional. I am going to re-read it tonight. It worths the time to invest in a good novel.",1
"The Embroidered Book by Kate Heartfield Has anyone read this? 

I finished it yesterday and absolutely loved it. I'm a historical fantasy fan in general, but this is my favourite book of the year. I loved the period details, the way the magic makes sense for the characters and world around them, the female centred and driven narrative and the relationship between Antoinette and Charlotte, and even Amalia, who never has dialogue. I've spent today reading about these 3 women and delving into their recorded lives and some of the other real life figures who featured (Emma Hamilton and Horatio Nelson) 

I even loved the ending. It hurt, but it felt like the right way to end it, and any other reimagining of history wouldn't have felt as hard hitting >!(if Antoinette had escaped to Charlotte and lived) !<

"A thought regarding ""Of Mice and Men"" So I read Of Mice and Men a few years ago for school, and it was presented to us as if George killing Lenny was an act of mercy, since he knew the farm workers will want him dead when they find out what he's done. And recently I've been thinking that it had a far more human, depressing reason. I think that even though George genrally likes Lenny because of his innocence, he's tired of carrying the burden of dealing with him. He's finally found a relatively safe and comfortable place to work, where he can earn some money and have a warm place to sleep in, a luxury he risks losing every time because of Lenny's behavior. Even if the farmers won't harm Lenny, they'll want him and George out of there, and George will lose a rare opportunity for work again. I think George subconciously decides to do it at that moment, cause he knows the time and reason are right. He's broken, he's tired, he has to put himself first, he has no time to be a grown parent to Lenny. And thinking it like that makes the whole story 10 times more depressing. What do you think?",1
"The Ramchandra Series - Thoughts/Opinions I read The Ramchandra Series by Amish Tripathy and well...

So there are four books in the series till now...... hopefully.

Rating: 6.8/10

The books are - 

Ram: The Scion of Ikshvaku

Sita: The Warrior of Mithila

Ravan: The Enemy of Aryavarta 

The War of Lanka

First, before continuing I would like to give a very, very brief summary of Ramayana, the Indian epic it is based on - 

Ram, the first prince of Ayodhya and a ""perfect"" man marries Sita by winning her hand in a bow lifting competition. They live happily ever after, or do they? No! They both with Ram's younger brother are exiled for 14 years, they live in forests until Ravan abducts Sita and then Ram goes to war and brings her back and they live happily ever after....... no still no, but that is another story.

Now, the books are well, good. Good on the lower end of the ""good"" spectrum. Let me tell why.

The first two books are a drag. If you do not know the epic and are not curious enough to read this then you won't be able to get through them. The real stuff starts from book three with Ravan, which I think is the best book in the series. The author has tried to humanize the characters who are supposed to be gods, and has not able to do it in a very good way, I may not be very religious but Ram, Sita, Lakshman they are supposed to be Gods, I literally pray to them on a daily basis, am I supposed to accept that suddenly that God is going - bro pass me the arrows... no. 

Second, he tried to present everything in a scientific way. Which spoiled the fun in many places a lot. For example, I would not spoil but in the original epic, Lord Hanuman is supposed to lift a whole mountain and fly to Ram, here it was just....bad. 

Now keeping aside my thoughts as a person who knew the original epic, what should you expect from this book as person not knowing about the epic or this author.

The story is good, the same old Ramayana. But I would say the original is better.  The story did have a twist which I did not expect. The previous books specially the Ravan were important for the final book and collectively seeing, the entire series is pretty good.

The writing, yes coming to the writing. It is, rough. course. he. uses. too. many. fullstops. like. why? The writing has no smoothness or flow to it. Have you read A Song of Ice and Fire? It is one of the best examples of smooth writings, in my opinion. I read that and came back to the series and it felt so weird.  It is not that bad but not that good either. 

Now coming to some of the historical references. ""Death may be the greatest of all human blessings"", Socrates said, and Amish quoted it when a character says this line, the character never said directly they heard it from Socrates, but they heard it in ""far west"" to which I may say - the story in the book is based on 3400 Bc..... SOCRATES WAS BORN IN 470 BC WHY ARE YOU QUOTING HIM STOP! I dont have much problem since he did not mention the name but eeeeehh, Irritated me a bit.

Fine, I will stop ranting, and give some serious thoughts. The entire series was good, Ravan was the best book. Writing was course but manageable. He used too many scientific terms which broke the flow of writing during battles. Are you looking to take a break from your romance novels or detective novels but not use too many of your brain cells? This is a pretty decent series to pick.

Thank you.",1
"I am Pilgrim - Terry Hayes I picked this book up after seeing it recommended my many many people at the bookstores. Am up to Chapter 23 and I just don’t get the appeal - I find the narrator to be annoyingly perfect (or a bit archetypal - he’s like Batman). I’m irritated by the characterisations of women (with far too  much implied sexual violence even given the setting of the story) and well … I don’t feel particularly enthusiastic about continuing.

Does it get better? Other than the short chapters, I’m not sure when or why I’m supposed to “find this un-putdown-able”",0

"Ego is the Enemy: The disease of me chapter reaction I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book just finished the disease of me chapter, and the last line disturbed me. I like to give credit where it is due, and the last line in that chapter about not caring about it felt wrong to me in the context of what if someone who is self-absorbed in a higher position, like in the office, took it even though it is yours wouldn’t that be wrong? Those people who benefit from your ideas without you being acknowledged damage your time and energy. This might be one of the tips in this book that I might not just follow because if you use it in a corporate setting, this is an opportunity for people to take advantage of you like it’s okay you don’t get the credit at least the work is done, is wrong in many levels.",0
"Hovering by Rhett Davis This novel is set in the fictional Australian city of Fraser. The city is undergoing a strange moving and shifting phenomenon, including streets changing directions and buildings changing location. The citizens have adapted to this uncertainty and transcience. Fraser is mostly based on Geelong, but feels like it could be almost any Australian city. There is a real Australian attitude of cultural cringe, sense of unbelonging, and colonial guilt salved by token acknowledgement of the indigenous people.


The plot involves an artist returning to her hometown and estranged family. The novel has an experimental style, with some sections presented in unusual formats, such as comments on news articles, conversations in text massages, or tables displaying split perspectives. This sometimes made the book difficult to read, however I could see the author made these choices to tie in with themes of seeking human connection online, and dealing with information overload in today's society.


What drew me to this book was the focus on trees. One character plays an online game based on trees, another character designs virtual trees, and the tree species are always being included in scenery descriptions. An ancient River Red Gum tree is an anchor and one of the few stable places in the changing landscape. In that way this book reminded me of *The Overstory* by Richard Powers. Interestingly, the author says some of their main influences were *Invisible Cities* by Italo Calvino, *A Visit From The Goon Squad* by Jennifer Egan, and *Lincoln in the Bardo* by George Saunders. 


Has anyone else here read this book? Any thoughts? I think it is a 2022 release that probably deserved more attention than it received.",1
"From Hierarchy to Ethnicity, by Alexander Lee This book is about the ways thinking about caste has changed, in India, as a result of politics and education, since pre-colonial times but mostly over the colonial and independence periods.  I wasn't any kind of expert on caste going in, and so even after finishing the book there was still a great deal I was clueless about.  But I notated the book intensely throughout, right up to the very last pages, and so it's safe to say it was a seriously valuable experience for me.  Unfortunately it was also quite an education about sociology, not a positive one, and I'd say a good half of what I learned was about that, instead.

It's really a miscommunication to refer to it as caste.  It's racism; or, that word communicates the situation much better than the word ""caste"" does.  India has upwards of 4,000 jatis, economic and cultural unions into which many if not all are born, none of which marry outside their circle.  There are exceptions, of course, many of them, and (apparently) always have been; but the rule and the vast majority observe the marriage barriers.

I know that will strike a questioning chord among the Americans here.  ""What do you mean, racism is about a marriage barrier?  It's so much more!"" (or so much less, depending on your politics).  Well - but if you raise the marriage barrier between so called white men and so called black women as high as it will go, and keep it there for three or four generations, no more so called white men will be produced in this country.  We will become a so called black society.  That will end the issue.  No races:  no racism.  Therefore the marriage barrier is central.  (I use the phrase ""so called"" because race is a fantasy, a Matrix-like illusion that has somehow taken over our culture.  Just for speed, I'll call them ""scw"" men and ""scb"" women from here on.)

So the marriage barrier is what racism is really, at heart, about.  And India has thousands of them.  But the Indians don't perceive the marriage barrier as central, any more than Americans do; they see it as simply one of the many cultural strictures that caste places upon them, strictures which may be avoided or evaded by one means or another, sometimes at the risk of their lives.  Because, you see, many of these strictures are not internally enforced, but externally, by other castes.  Indians - some of them - fought a war, back in the 1850s, over whether the women of a particular caste would be allowed to cover their boobies in public.  Before the war, they couldn't wear tops.  They had to go topless in public.  I don't have any idea how many of such outrageous strictures caste enforces, but that one is certain.  The practice of untouchability is another.  There are those who belong to no caste, and these are called untouchables, and a very large proportion (20-40%) of the caste populace observes the practice of treating such people as unclean.  They will not touch them, they will not dine with them, they will not allow them into the temple to pray.  I'm sure there are other restrictions upon untouchables.

So you see caste is not always a gentle system.  It's a kind of informal, community enforced, extremely broad-based aristocracy, based not as European aristocracies are, on the king pointing his finger at an individual and saying, ""You:  you're special, and this is exactly HOW special"" but on cleanliness, which is a result of historically determinable origins, habits and practices, and which is (of course) therefore the subject of court cases to establish the ""truth"" of some person or some group's ""actual"" caste status.

And caste has changed a great deal based on who is running India and how they have run it.  Before the British came along, the informality of caste meant that castes who became wealthy, whether by trade, luck, or military prowess, could gradually (or perhaps not so gradually) improve their caste status by changing their behavior, claiming ancient unverifiable kinship with so-and-sos, and spending money in the right places.  Under the British, the discovery of caste by the British and the introduction of state bureaucracy formalized and solidified what had been much more fluid and malleable, making the whole system far less amenable to individual circumstances.  The caste system, instead of being community enforced (or in addition to being community enforced) now came to be enforced, so to speak, at the point of a gun.  Once the British left - it's still not quite clear WHY they left, although the fact that they had to use actual Indians to police the system had to have something to do with it - they left democracy behind, and while not universal education, much better and much more broadly applied education than had been the case when they arrived.  The fact that the Indians now ran their own government meant that they could tax themselves as they pleased and to what ends they desired, and they desired to divert as many government resources as possible to the ones that voted for them, that is, to their castes.  But in order to get elected in the first place they had to have more than just their caste voting for them - with 4,000 castes and only 36 state and union territory governments, plus the federal government, it's easy to see that no one caste would ever be able to provide all the votes needed to get elected - and so politicians needed a more broad-based ""type of caste"" appeal.  Well, they had the technology and they got it done.

But enough of that.  Onward to sociology.  This guy, this author, seems to imagine he's contributing to some grand unified theory of the politics of ethnicities.  Again and again he talks about how his theory modifies that of others, and whose is more plausible and whose is less plausible and why.  And that is just so many different kinds of wrong I can hardly encompass it.

First, sociology is a subfield of psychology, and psychologists have discovered nothing fundamental.  Nothing to which all psychologists turn, to direct their work, as chemists turn to the periodic table, or as physicists to the fundamental laws of thermodynamics.  They know nothing.  They have many very interesting experiments, and that is all.

Second, the idea that you're going, eventually, to make people predictable, in any very useful way, flies in the face of all common sense and history.  If we were predictable we wouldn't be people.  Unpredictability is at the core of what it means to be human; maybe even at the core of what it means to be alive.  Read Frans de Waal's book, Chimpanzee Politics, and discover just how complex and unique and interesting one single tribe of chimpanzees is.  If you can't predict that - and how could you ever - how can you hope to do better with people?  Watch the mating dance of mosquitoes, at dusk, and discover just how jazzy and improvisational life is.  To think otherwise is nuts.  NUTS.

Third, to reduce any human process to factors like how much education they have and what their socioeconomic status is amounts to carefully removing the flesh, from a skeleton, and thinking your resulting studies of that skeleton are going to have something to do with human behavior.  Well, without skeletons we couldn't stand upright, and that would have an effect on our politics; but these are not very useful considerations.  I'm sure you all can see that.

I'm sure there's more to object to, but my mind recoils.  What sociology has become, what our students are being taught as if it were knowledge, is awful.  If we were to shoot all the sociologists and start over, it wouldn't be all bad.  The field of sociology would experience a great leap forward.",0
"Which movie or TV adaptation is the biggest let down for you? I have just finished watching movie adaptation of No Exit by Taylor Adams. It couldn't replicate the suspense and thrill of the book at all. Some essence of the characters are removed. The movie couldn't show the psychopathic nature of the antagonist.

I recently enjoyed LOTR Ring of Power and One of Us Is Lying TV adaptation so maybe my hope is too high for No Exit.

So what's your biggest let down?",1
"Nothing But Blackened Teeth - anyone who has read this, what did you think? For those who haven’t read it. It’s written by Cassandra Khaw, and it’s a haunted house short story (said house is an old, creepy Japanese manor), surrounding the story of a group of friends. Pretty much all of them have a strained relationship with each other. 

Anyways, what did everyone who read it think of it? I’m curious about others opinions. I thought it was decent, but unfortunately rather short. I wish we could’ve gotten to see the characters relationships to each other more fleshed out than they were. I couldn’t really connect with any of them because of how fast paced it was. 

Regardless, the detail given to the house and all the messed up stuff happening was amazing. Khaw really, truly made the house come alive through words. 

I read this on a plane ride a couple weeks ago and it was a decent, short book I finished within about two hours. People who like creepy, haunted house or unsettling books should definitely check it out.

Edit: decent is a better synonym for what I originally used. Fits better with my opinions of the book",0
"Warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson Warbreaker is another beautiful story by Brandon Sanderson in the Cosmere Universe. Like other books by the author, this is a lengthy read or long listening session for the audiobook. This story is a slow burn, you have to read at least the first ten chapters to appreciate the story. The characters are lovely and the journey they experience throughout the book shows their maturity from sheltered naivety to the harsh realities of life. The story is impeccably paced for the sheer density of words that never felt tedious to read.

I will recommend fantasy book enthusiasts to give it a try.",1
"What is a moment in a book that you don’t think the author intended to be funny, but made you laugh? (Besides obviously bad writing) For me, it was the following scene in Death’s End by Cixin Liu (book 3 of the Three Body problem trilogy). I’m spoiler tagging it just in case; please note I’m *not* done with the book. The stuff below is a major spoiler for The Dark Forest (book 2) as well. 

>!The crew of *Bronze Age* is being tried for crimes against humanity. Over 10 years ago, when an alien probe quickly destroyed most of Earth’s 1,000+ ship space fleet, a few ships escaped with low fuel reserves and simultaneously realized the only way their respective crews could survive was to attack their fellow surviving ships and take their fuel and spare parts so they could fly away from a doomed Earth. In the present day, Earth summons them back from their path away from the solar system, promising them that they have been granted high military honors for escaping the battle and being willing to continue the human race on their own. Now it is time to come home. Except this is a trap, and they are being criminally charged. At one point during the trial, the prosecution asks what the crew did with the bodies from the ship they attacked. It is discovered that they took the bodies and mixed the meat in with the rest of their food, and that no one really protested this decision at the time because without this half of the crew would have eventually starved to death. A captain on the stand then recollects a moment where a crew member found someone’s tracking chip in his food and used his ID scanner to determine the identity of the person he was eating, and then said, “Thank you, Carol Joiner” as he ate her remains.!<

>!The part that made me laugh:!<

>!Judge: Order! Order in the courtroom! Please remove those who have fainted.!<

I don’t think this line was meant to be funny but I howled with laughter. For any sci fi fans, this series is a must! It is mostly humor free but for some reason this line got me good 😂",1
"It Can’t Happen Here, really hard to follow at first I’m trying to read this book and idk if I’m alone here but it feels like the first 6 chapters is just introducing character after character with nothing actually happening except character introductions. I can’t keep track of this many people unless I make a spread sheet. Hopefully it will get better because the book has a lot of praise but right now I’m just struggling.",0
"The Terror by Dan Simmons Just finished reading ‘The Terror’ by Dan Simmons, a lengthy novel about the Franklin expedition to the Arctic.

Curious about other people’s thoughts on this book. 

I enjoyed it, but I also understand the criticisms I have heard about the book being too long, slow, and wordy. I think some of these criticisms stem from expectations of a horror story, which is usually - but not always - fast-paced, accessible, and packed with thrills.

‘The Terror’ leans more to literary than genre, and it certainly has a slow build that never really seems to pay off, aside from the character arc.

The first two hundred pages take some commitment as the reader must digest page after page of technical writing about the ship, and then, even when the monster appears, the story remains more literary.

I was very impressed with the author’s research and knowledge about the time period, the ship, and all the small details that make this story feel authentically told. At the same time, the amount of detail sometimes makes the book feel bloated and slow-paced.

Some things I didn’t really grasp: why the novel shifts between present tense and past tense. Seems random and almost like an amateurish mistake, but I imagine there might be an artistic reason for this?

Another thing I didn’t understand was why Goodsir’s diary had Random capitalizations all throughout His writing just like I am Doing now. Was Pretty Annoying!

One last thing I really didn’t like, and I would’ve suggested cutting as an editor, was that section near the end explaining the Real People history. I skimmed it and could not appreciate any part of it - felt like the author wanted to reach a certain word count.

Overall, I enjoyed the book more than I disliked it, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a character-based literary novel with chilling elements rather than a horror story.

What’s your opinion? Did I miss anything",1
"Finished a heart-wrenching true biography called ""From orphan to High-flyer"" I very rarely go for biographies but have read ""From Orphan to High-flyer"" by Philip Martin and Denis Elliot which made me completely change my mind about it 

Together they coauthored this biograpgy about Denis Elliott's life, his very humble and heartbreaking upbringing in an orphanage, struggles with foster parents to then become a pilot in the RAF in the far east during WW2 at the mere age of 18. 

The book is written in a very unique manner, a question and answer format, so each story you hear in Denis's own words, just like you are sitting in the same room as these two friends having a chat among each other with a cup of tea. Which is also another point to make, Philip being Denis's carer and best friend despite being over 60 years younger than him, wanting to make sure no details are left out and seemingly so much care for the older gentleman. 

I also really liked to be able to look at all the information on their website along with the book tl really visulize where all thr operations had taken Denis. 

[https://www.fromorphantohighflyer.com/](https://www.fromorphantohighflyer.com/)

I highly recommend this book to anyone, whether you are into non-fiction or not. Reading about Denis, with his awful background, to see the confident man he grew into at such a young age, really made me put my own life into perspective and I think we really need to treasure the stories from this generation and what better way than reading a first hand account on it?",1
"If you could only list one book you feel is a pure masterpiece, what would it be and why? For me it would be The Children of Hurin by Tolkien. I feel like this book gets overshadowed by the LotR trilogy and nobody bats an eye at this masterpiece of a book. It is extremely dark and sets up some very major characters for Tolkien's world, all with a captivating story line that was incredibly difficult for me to put down. I never felt that type of engagement with LotR, but this one definitely latched onto me where I kept wanting more.",1
"Carrie Soto review I'm seeing a lot of negative or underwhelmed reviews of Carrie Soto is Back by Taylor Jenkins Reid. I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed it. I would agree that it is not as good as The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, but while always enjoyable, none of TJR other books are as good as Evelyn Hugo. I would agree that in spite of some clever writing there are parts the plot which lag. 

But I really enjoyed reading the character study of an unashamedly ambitious and driven woman. A spiky, aggressive and emotionally underdeveloped woman. We see the price she is made pay for her 'unfeminine' attitude. She is a very unusual character to see portrayed sympathetically. 

I kept thinking about how toxic the Tennis Press has been over the years. To Martina Navratilova because she wasn't as pretty as Steffie Graff and I imagine because they knew she was gay, Martina Hengis for grunting, Venus and Serena for every little bloody thing, just plain bullying Naomi Osaka off the tour because she didn't want to do press. 

Yes Carrie Soto can be unlikable as anything. But she is still a great character.",1
"Thoughts on The House in the Cerulean Sea by T.J. Klune The Amazing:

Arthur's Phoenix form. We don't get enough books with phoenixes in them.

&#x200B;

The Great:

\-I really like how this story teaches life lessons and morality that everyone should know and keep in mind. 

\-This story is filled with love, warmth, color, sassiness, humor, good vibes, and magical wonder throughout. 

\-Children/Middle Grade/some adults should definitely read this book to spark an inner monologue of their view on discrimination, biases, government systems, and accepting others for who they are.

-Lucy. The spin on Lucifer was really refreshing. Nature vs Nurture with the AntiChrist is an interesting topic.

&#x200B;

The Good:

The writing was good. I wasn't blown away by it. It was quirky, and painted a Pixar-ish world. 

&#x200B;

The Okay:

\-The ending was very predictable. Towards the end I knew what was going to happen and was just waiting for it to get there. Not a dealbreaker with this story; just kinda obvious.

\-I feel like there was some insta-love going on. In the beginning, the main character is seen as very dull, yet is loved almost immediately, when I just didnt see the charm until he developed later on.

&#x200B;

The Bad:

\-This story has too many morality lessons thrown at you. It seems like every conversation it turns into some profound lesson on how to view the world and how to treat people around you. Like I said, for children this is great because they need to learn this, but as an adult reading this it was excessive and came off as preachy.

\-Some repetivness in descriptions. A girls hair was described as ""red like fire"" 3 times. The wyverns ""eyes rolled back in ecstacy"" twice. Little repitions that broke the flow a bit.

&#x200B;

The Controversial:

\-I'm aware this book was inspired by the 1960s scoop/genocide of Canadian native children. I'm not sure if that changes my feelings in any way, but I think that as the author isn't a Canadian Native, it seemed like a slightly strange thing to be inspired by, especially seeing how Linus, the governmental worker, is shown at one point to be the hero.

&#x200B;

Other Thoughts:

\-This story could also be seen as an allegory for conversion therapy for LGBTQ+, or the segregation of blacks, along with other scenarios that I'm unaware of. Maybe some readers could see their struggle in this book.

\-This is the first fictional book I've read with modern terms used like ""toxic masculinity"" and ""special snowflake"". You can see the authors lingo slipping through there.

\-I spent 17 years in foster care. If I read this book as a foster child I would've probably loved this book since I just wanted a home to call my own and not be seen as less then by some others. Now though, I think this is a cute, warm, happy book, but it didn't make my heart flutter like it seems to with so many others. 

&#x200B;

In a vacuum this is a well done, heart-warming fantasy book with lots of color and love. It didn't move me like I thought it would, and I thought it was a little preachy, but overall it's a cozy read that I'm sure most people could enjoy.

Edit: removed the repitition of ""Wouldn't you like to be here?"" from The Bad since it was a literary device.",1
"Finally left A Little Life as DNF. I know I'm quite late but here are my thoughts.  I've finally decided to leave A Little Life as DNF(500 pages). it is long, boring, slow, and most importantly \*\*perverse\*\*. I thought of the book as a complex life story of 4 friends w ups and downs, and it is their life that makes the readers cry. Like in A Thousand Splendid Suns, one doesn't feel emotions primarily for the physical pain felt by the characters, but for how life turns out for them. When Mariam gets married to an older man or is caught by the Taliban, it is the fear one felt for the character's fate which was so special about the book. And yes, the writing was brilliant as well.

But in A Little Life it's all around one guy who was hurt by people, is hurting himself, is again hurt by people, and keeps hurting himself. refusing any help at all. it becomes annoying to see the same shit happening over and over again for 450 pages. as if the author is a sadist, feeling good by hurting the characters. and MOST of it is physical pain so one cannot even begin to empathize cus the events are so unreal.

  
I hate Hanya Yanigahara atm and IDK what makes a sane person write something like this. This isn't any real sexual abuse survivor's tale but how the author believes such a victim lives his life. It is absolute perverseness. One GoodReads review described the book as 'torture porn'. And it is exactly that.

  
The plot doesn't make sense, you cannot connect to the protagonist (unless someone believes that this is how a sexually abused man lives and feels, and thinks). I'm also surprised how so many YouTube book tubers liked this book.

  
But this is an absolute mockery of an imaginary person's life. More so bcz stuff like this doesn't happen in real life. and even if it does, all of it does not happen to the same person.  
The writing is the only positive thing about the book. But once it starts repeating the same misery over and over and over, even the writing cannot make someone endure this.

  
the book is a success if someone wants to create an imaginary character, inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on him, then make him self-pitying and helpless, and ironically give him such an ego which makes it impossible for people to help him, and then disguise the ego as 'denial' of abuse. Make the imaginary man incapable of repair and keep inflicting pain and misery and torture, and then sit back and enjoy it and disguise this joy of reading as 'the most sad and painful book ive ever read' 

I read the summary of the book on some website and I'm glad I did not keep reading. It is completely ridiculous.",0
"Allow Me to Retort: A Black Guy’s Guide to the Constitution by Elie Mystal Allow Me to Retort: A Black Guy’s Guide to the Constitution by Elie Mystal

Imagine Molly Ivins was a black lawyer from New York who wanted to explain the Constitution amendment by amendment and advocate for reform. That will give you a sense of the irreverent writing style in this book. Elie Mystal is a Harvard trained lawyer, the son of a politician and legal correspondent for the Nation magazine. The book is clear, concise, passionate and funny. He even quotes the Muppets to make a point. A fraction of his subject matter is four or so years out of date. There is nothing about the Dobbs decision or Ketanji Brown Jackson. However, up to the historical moment he stops writing, the book goes through the bill of rights as it is applied, summing up controlling cases and interactions between the Justices and a lot of history as to how we got where we are in the US legal system. Most of what he describes is still governing law today. Mystal is an advocate for black people rights, minority rights, womens rights, queer and trans rights. He has a case to make and he makes it. Even people who end up disagreeing with his proposals for reform can learn from this clear summary about the law as it stands.",1
"Misery Book vs Movie I just finished reading Misery and then watched the movie both for the first time. I gotta say both were great but I definitely liked the book better for two reasons. 

1.  I’m not the fastest reader and am busy with other things so I can’t really just sit and read for extended periods,  so the agony and dread  really built in a way a <2 hour movie could. Paul’s suffering really hit harder. 
2. The lack of outside information (ie Sheriff) in the books really increased the sense of isolation and dependence on Annie. (Although it did make her killing him more impactful than just a random state trooper.",1
"Kafka On The Shore: thoughts Kafka On The Shore is my first  Murakami read.  I'd describe the experience as surreal and addicting. I can't really point my finger at the reason for liking the book. 

Kafka's adventure was amazing to me. Oshima was a likeable character. I particularly enjoyed the Nakata and Hoshima plot a lot. The easy description, mystical and surreal atmosphere, philosophical characters and open for interpretation ending (I guess this defines Murakami?) was the main part of the book and likely my reasons for liking it.

What threw me off was the incest and the problematic sexual relationships though. I've never read a book with such vivid illustration of weird sex. After reading the part with >!Kafka who is a minor and his mother's sexual relationship and Kafka raping his sister, I was so uncomfortable and grossed.!< I know its supposed to be according to the character's dream which follows a mythology story, nonetheless it felt terrible. 

I've learnt about Murakami's obsession with such plot and misogyny with some research later. So, what're your thoughts?

Tldr: it's good but weird.",1
"What's a book that you feel gets unnecessary hate? I really hate the current trend to shit on classic books. Like the Great Gatsby for instance. No matter how you feel about the book, it provides a sharp critique of the bourgeoisie and provides a clear analysis on class. 

Don't get me wrong. People are allowed to not like a book, they are allowed to critique the flaws of a popular book, but sometimes the hatred is uncalled for.",1
"The Expanse [no spoilers] OK. I know this potentially is a duplicate of many other similar posts, but I don’t care, because I am hyped right now.

Frankly, I don’t read that much fictional, and mostly strange philosophical or science stuff. I read fiction in the past, but didn’t have enough energy for it in the recent years (because OMG Nietzsche takes a toll). But after the pretty nice impression The Expanse TV series made on me, I wanted to give the universe a textbook try. Just liked the characters and wanted to know how the strange loose ends of the series might be tied up together - as there are several books of the main story line that didn’t make it into the series.

So, to keep true to no spoilers, I only want to say two things: first, transition from the series to the books was quite easy. Even after book ten, the melange of the TV interpretation and the books characters fits really nicely. Sure, they changed things. But it made an overall nice TV series, and the books - to me - just carry the same vicious humor and twists the characters have, playing out on a galaxy wide scale. I was sooooo happy to follow them along, some for a shorter period, and some for longer.

Second, the ending - and I was sooo scared about the ending, that’s always what can leave me so frustrated, and the longer and more spanning the saga the greater the risk - really was fulfilling. I’m neither saying it’s a good or a bad ending here, but I had fun. It tingled. It was really really satisfying.

So if you are into SciFi, and ever wondered how The Expanse plays out after the TV series, I’d hereby like to encourage you to read the books. Obviously start at the beginning, because a) there are differences and b) it’s just so cool.

Your mileage may vary.

I am happy to read your own experiences in the comments, good or bad :-)",1
"Reamde I went in almost completely blind, just knowing it's supposed to be some kind of geeky thriller. And it was geeky, and it was a thriller, but it kind of felt like two stories in a trench coat.

First there was the making-of story of the MMORPG T'Rain, which I found quite entertaining. The game was described as innovative while staying reasonably realistic, and there was no sense of wish-fullfilment or aggrandization. Even though the founder and his crew were portrayed as likeable people overall, they were sleazy in their business and there were several good observations about how tech companies trick, manipulate and exploit people.

One part that particularly stuck to me is how the author predicted the ""play to earn"" fad. Funnily enough, his version of it even involved mining, although in a more traditional sense.

>The game that Corporation 9592 built had any number of novel features, but in Richard’s mind their most fundamental innovation was that they built it from the ground up to be gold-farmer-friendly. Gold farming had been an unwelcome by-product, an epiphenomenon, of earlier games, which had done all that they could to suppress the practice, even to the point of getting the Chinese government to ban such transactions in 2009. But in Richard’s opinion, any industry that was clocking between $1 and $10 billion a year deserved more respect. Allowing that tail to wag that dog could only lead to increased revenue and customer loyalty. It was only necessary to structure the game’s virtual economy around the certainty that gold farmers would colonize it in vast numbers.  
>  
>...  
>  
>He sensed at a primal, almost olfactory level that the game could only be as successful as the stability of its virtual currency. This led him to investigate the history of money and particularly of gold. Gold, he learned, was considered to be a reliable store of value because extracting it from the ground required a certain amount of effort that tended to remain stable over time. When new, easy-to-mine gold deposits were found, or new mining technologies developed, the value of gold tended to fall.

But aside from the tech & business aspect, I enjoyed reading about the quirky personalities behind the game, particularly the conflict between the two creative leads - a famous, perpetually busy traditionalist fantasy author who wrote his first drafts in in-universe languages and actually lived in a medieval castle, and a modern author famous for his extreme output and love of random apostrophes - which ultimately leaked into the game's community.

Unfortunately, this storyline never really went anywhere. For all the interesting backstory, there was no actual story to go along with it. It intersected with the other plotline only a few times, and for those purposes, knowing that it's an MMORPG with a sizeable gold farming industry would be all the backstory needed.

The other plotline was a generic thriller about kidnapping and terrorists. The pacing was good, there was enough suspense to keep me interested, overall, it was fine for what it was, but I feel it had an opposite problem from the first plotline, being paper thin. We got a brief biography of the Big Bad, the international terrorist Jones, in form of an info-dump, but that was it. Nothing much was said about his motivations or long-term goals, other than that it involved killing lot of people. I would have expected a bit more depth from a story of this length.

There was also an abundance of plot armor, both for some of the protagonists and for Jones. A memorable instance was during the climatic shoot-out at the end, when Jones literally had a gun pointed to someone and went ""I would have shot anyone else instantly, buy I'm surprised to see you here, so let's chat"". And they did not even get to chat, on account of being in the middle of a chaotic gunfight.

I wonder how this book came to be - did the author have 2 ideas in stash and decided to blend them into one novel? Did he start writing the T'Rain story, expanding on background, then got stuck and came up with the Jones plot to help move things along, losing track of the original premise along the way? Or perhaps a little bit of both?

But not end this on negative note, I found the book enjoyable, though I recommend it more to fans of thrillers than to fans of geeky stuff. The prose was good, the pacing was good, it just lacked a little in cohesion and big picture. I'm considering giving a shot to some of the author's other works. How do they compare?",1
"Stephen Fry's The Liar confused me a lot. I guess, at times it was a point of it, no?

The non-chronological telling of the story wasn't so bad when it wasn't so drastic. In the end most of the things fall into place, but I can't say I understood Adrian Healy's story fully. He's an unreliable narrator\\protagonist, right? Hence the name of the book?

I'm not male, gay or british. The britishness of the book fried my brain a little bit. Especially the croket chapter.

But It was alright, I think.",1
"I hurt my neck reading Dune I’ve just recently gotten into science fiction, I was intrigued by the story but hesitant about the length. When I was gifted the book for my birthday, my whole family mocked me for its length and after 2,5 months of reading, I finally finished it. 

I loved the plot and really enjoyed the complexity of the world and the incredible attention to detail. In spite of many comments I received, I don’t consider it to be a hard book to read. The politics were never too overwhelming, the dialogue was just right. The uneventfulness is what made Dune a very comforting read; only 2-3 times throughout did I find myself restlessly continuing on to a new chapter, wishing to know what is to occur. Sure, as far as science fiction goes, it is the most static book you could possibly imagine. And precisely that is what makes it all the more human. 

Now onto the neck thing. About two weeks ago, I reached the middle of the book. Wanting to finish it by the end of the year, I decided to isolate myself for the whole weekend, brushing the rest of the world aside to read. I did that, and then I did that the whole following week, and finally finished the next Saturday. 

Then consequences came to bite me in the ass. It has been a week since Dune was done and dusted, a week with a pinched nerve in my neck causing intensely irritating pain, a week of sleeping in a pillow-less bed hoping to anything holy that it might get better next morning. I guess I now know a fraction of the discomfort the Fremen learned to live with in the desert. 

Please learn from my mistakes, stretch a little every now and then. And tread carefully with Big Books. :)",1
"I gave a taboo romance book 5 stars after it was 4 stars for 10 months Underneath the Sycamore Tree by B. Celeste

When I first read this book I gave it 4 stars because the content of the book was something that kind of weirded me out and it was not my usual cup of tea, but I found the writing to be good the main character was interesting to me and the family relationships that were occurring really kept me invested though I honestly was not the biggest fan of the love interest

Despite all of these reasons though I enjoyed it a lot and gave it 4 stars and when I was done reading I decided to listen to the songs that are featured in the book to provide more context to the scenes and I instantly became sad again.

Fast forward 10 months I still can not stop thinking about what happened in the book and it immediately put me in an emotional mood, I had to give it 5 stars if a book makes me think about it that much, not even my favorite book does that as often as this book, I highly recommend though it won't be for everyone.",1
"Recently finished the Andromeda Strain and I have...concerns Hey all so this is my first post here. I have been burning through a long list of books with my wife as we have started reading aloud to one another in the evenings. Crichton has long been on my list of books to read and this was at the top as one of his first foundational works. 

But my problem with the Andromeda Strain simply is that it is one of the worst books I have ever read. I have like 3 main arguments I will outline to support this claim

1. This novel is described as a thriller but Crichton writes it like a snoozefest documentary. The book is long winded, the character uninteresting as each is a man whose background is described in excruciating detail without really giving me any idea of their actual personality. Stone is smart, Burton is smart, Levitt is stupid as shit despite being a highly decorated scientist and they all shit on Hall for being a doctor. Perspective changes do little to liven up this drab foursome and Peter Jackson (the old Sterno drinking man) winds up being the most interesting character. Crichton also rarely uses opportunities to progress the plot which results in a last 60 pages that actually are interesting but end with a deus-ex-none of this mattered. He does this all the while going into shockingly incorrect and long winded descriptions of how science works.

2. For context my wife is a biochemist currently pursuing her PhD in Biology and it was brutal having to pause every few minutes as she tore apart the dozens upon dozens of inaccuracies. The descriptions of instruments and what they do were inaccurate, how pH works in context of our body was incorrect in many places, and overall the descriptions are dull and irritatingly redundant. I quite literally began skipping whole sections of scientific jerking off without any impact to the story. 

3. Lastly, I get that it was 1969, but the dryness of this book cannot be overstated. It reads worse than a lot of the reports I had to read when I was in the military and rarely did I feel truly invested in the story. I have read a lot of books from this era which tend to be a bit lacking in character development for a mostly male cast of characters (because men are only mad or glad of course lmao) but at no point did I find something in the story which actually made me give a shit about them not blowing themselves and the entire world up with them. And in the end I felt like none of the story mattered to begin with due to the mutation of Andromeda at the 11th hour. 

I don't know what I'm missing everyone! So many people have these excellent reviews of the book! Is it a matter of ignorance being bliss or do the self reported fans just belong over on r/iamverysmart? Because I cannot align the positive reviews with what I just spent the last several weeks suffering through.",0
"What author do you wish you have the complete copy of all their published work? Mine would be R.L. Stine.

To be honest, as a 3rd world country citizen, Ghoosebumps was very hard to come-by. Good thing there was a store that sells second hand books from America and other countries. That was where I got my first Ghoosebumps book, the night of the living dummy. Starting then I was hooked. I was only able to get like 5 ghoosebump novels in total, but I had a three story collection of Fear Park. As a teacher living in Thailand (not my home country), I try to see every second hand book store here if they have any copies of his books. Sadly, they only come few and far between.",1
"Nick Cutter's ""The Troop"": a visceral experience. I first came across this author's name through one of the posts on r/books which was a list on the most disturbing books. ""The Troop"" was on that list. Later on one of my trips to Barnes & Noble I would see a copy of the novel and, of course, picked along with some other titles.

I would eventually get to it and once I started reading the first part to it I found myself taken on an extremely dark voyage. Set on Falstaff Island, a scout master and his troop make their yearly trip to a cabin situated on it. What was supposed to be a relaxing tradition takes a turn for the worse when a strange man stumbles into their campsite. The man is horribly pale, and hideous pale, and also a has a voracious appetite. And not long both the scoutmaster and his troop are exposed to something horrible that goes beyond words.

I have read the horror fiction works of Clive Barker and those stories can be quite disturbing. Nick Cutter's ""The Troop"" is very much disturbing and horrific. Plus it's also constructed in the same manner as Stephen King's ""Carrie"", which Cutter drew inspiration from, as it includes news articles, interviews and magazine profiles. And on an interesting note the master of horror has even sang his praise of it!

Sidenote: The book also includes an excerpt of another of Cutter's novels, ""Little Heaven"".",1
Born Standing Up I just read this biography kind of thing by Steve Martin. I feel like I've heard it said by a lot of comedians. Pretty good read. I read it in like two days. Some interesting reflections. He said that performing comedy for a big crowd is like a celebration of celebrity and bears nothing to the quality of the comedy. Talked about a lot of the classic stuff. Funny to hear about him coming up. Pretty good read.,1
"how do you pick between re-reads and new books? I've been in this eternal book struggle where I desperately want to re-read books that I know I love but also feel anxious about wanting to read the books I have that I haven't read. In 2022 I've ONLY read new books, but I'm staring at my beloved Series of Unfortunate Events wanting to read it again. However, I keep going back and forth on whether or not to spend all that time on several new books I could read instead (and maybe find new favorites!). How do you balance your time between re-reads and new books?",1
"If you could revive one author to finish their story who would it be? Mine would be Kentaro Miura, the author of Berserk. I know story is still going on but it not him writing it, it is fragments of what people think he wanted the story to be, in other words it not pure Kentaro Miura's imagination. So who would that author be for you? what story do you wish to be complete?

Edit: This post made me realise how many of us consider G.R.R.M dead, majority also want Tolkien to complete his work and how many great authors die before completing their work",1
"City of Thieves is the first book I ever read in one day This book was just so much fun. I absolutely loved Lev and Kolya's banter and I could read a book that was just Kolya's rantings. Their friendship is definitely now one of my favorite fictional relationships. As well, I thought it was hilarious how time in the book was basically tracked by how long it had been since Kolya took a shit last. I've read plenty of books that are widely considered to be funny (a few discworld books, good omens, hitchhikers guide) and the biggest reaction it'll ever get out of me is an exhale from the nose and that's about it. 

This book genuinely made me laugh out loud so many times, like when Kolya says some absolutely heinous things about someone's mother to prove he's a native Russian speaker and not a german spy. Still, I appreciate that it knew when to take itself seriously, some scenes were very tense to read. My only critique is that I wish it was longer. I'm sure this book spits in the face of historical accuracy and everything, but god damn, it was an incredibly fun read that was an absolute breeze to read. I took a quick break from the Count of Monte Cristo for a few days and this book was exactly the quick change of pace I needed to be able to pick up Monte Cristo again and keep reading it.",1
"Reading “I’m Glad My Mom Died” soon after my own mom died. I had a very tense relationship with my mom and she died unexpectedly this year. Jennette McCurdy’s book came out shortly after her funeral and I considered reading it right away but thought it would be better for my mental health to wait a few months. Last week I decided it was time. I finished it in less than a day.

I’ve struggled with an eating disorder since I was in high school. My mom, though she was a good person, had her own issues with food and was one of the main causes of my bulimia. She was also very religious. I think my own childhood helped me to view McCurdy’s memoir through a different lens. I know what religious trauma can do to you. I know how eating disorders can easily be sparked by some careless words and nurtured by family members. I know how confusing it is when a parent dies and you have conflicting emotions about it. Ungenerous thoughts you’re afraid to even admit. 

McCurdy’s description of the days surrounding her mom’s death hit me hard. Some chapters could’ve been taken from my journal. It’s odd to have such a similar experience as a complete stranger. I laughed, I cried, and I gritted my teeth to get through this book. Part of me is glad I choose to read it after all and part of me wishes I never picked it up.  

Have any of you had a similar experience with this memoir? Or any another book where you read it at a time in your life when it aligned closely with what was happening to you and was a very emotional read for you?",1
"William Forstchen's ""One Second After"" I have very mixed feelings on this book. On one hand, I'm from about 20 miles away where the book is set, and my hometown is mentioned throughout - this may not be special to some, but for someone from a small, rural town, it's pretty cool to recognize local landmarks. Also, I love the premise - as a fan of books about the apocalypse (from *Alas, Babylon* to *The Stand,* I've read all of them I can find), reading about EMP attacks gave me a whole 'nother thrill.

On the other hand, the book takes a ham-fisted approach to politics. You can definitely tell where the author stands - not necessarily always a bad thing, but it's not done well. I mean, the >!main antagonist(s) are Satan-worshipping cannibals. Really?!< Not to mention the constant injection of right-wing libertarian politics, which only gets clumsier in the 2nd and 3rd books, to the point where it's heavily implied that >!Hillary Clinton knew about the EMP attack before it came, and instead of warning the nation, evacuated her and the other Washington elites to some secret underground bunker. I mean, seriously.!< There are graceful ways to be political in your writings - William Forstchen hasn't embraced them yet.

"The Great Believers Im only half way through the book but I wanted to discuss with someone who’s read it. God I’m so frustrated with Yale and Charlie, I’m in the part where Yale finds out about Charlie’s diagnosis and it seems so unfair to me that Charlie is shutting him out. Yale deserves answers and to know if he has a chance of being sick. I’m really enjoying this book but this detail is really frustrating to me. What did you guys think about it?",1
"Richard Overy's ""Blood and Ruins"" Just want to give {{Blood and Ruins}} a plug. I'm not an authority on World War II or books about it, but it's the first book I've seen that puts that war and its predecessor in a context where they make  sense -- the decline and fall of overt imperialism and the rise of nation-states in looser and less formal blocs. (Whether these blocs aren't just empires by another name is another question, which I would answer by saying names matter.)

It's weighing on my mind a bit because I just finished the chapter on the extermination of Jews, Roma, and other minorities, and it was a dismal slog: Germany, its allies, and its puppet regimes all had their own unique variations of dispossessing, deporting, starving, shooting, working to death, gassing.... The one relatively bright spot was that Italy was a slacker, at least until Germany occupied two-thirds of its territory. 

But I wouldn't expect the history of a war that killed at least ten million people to be cheerful reading. The rewards are more in being able to understand some of Germany's (and Japan's) actions that never made sense to me, like attacking the Soviet Union, and seeing how ideas and movements that began before the war evolved to make today's world, and are still evolving and at work.

Overy gives a good account of the military progress of the war with reasonable detail without getting lost in the minutiae of individual engagements. I'd say if you read one book about World War II, read this one.",1
"Just finished Broken Harbor I recently finished Broken Harbor by Tana French and it was gut wrenching and brilliant. As usual, her plotting and pacing are perfect. The moral dilemmas she conjures are expertly woven into her narrative and they are so complex and nuanced. By the end, each brutal development in the case and in the main character's life were gut punches. Family drama/tragedy is a good way to describe this mystery novel and it is replete with tragedy. This novel is devastating and beautiful. Tana French is a genius.",1
"Erasure by Percival Everett I’m not very widely read outside of genre fiction (sci-fi), so as an adult I’ve been trying to branch out more. I just finished Erasure and really enjoyed it, though admittedly as an engineer I’m not strong on literary analysis, so some references were lost on me. I’m still working through it, reading up on things I know I missed, but the very end really confused me. Can someone help me out? If you haven’t read it, recommend not reading comments until you do, since it’ll spoil it for you. I don’t know if I’m just dense or what, but I’m also confused on the conversation about the drawing that is erased and then sold as an erasure…I’m trying to relate it to the title and rest of the work, but I know I’m missing things. Help this non-literary-but-trying reader out please!! 😀",1
"Question about a detail in ""Girl on the Train"" Tom says Rachel leaves constant drunken messages harassing him which we later learn were actually from Megan when she was angry, but he also says Rachel sent him a cruel email while completely inebriated, even attacking his baby Evie. Rachel is confused because this sounds nothing like her and to the reader it truly doesn't. The issue of course is she gets so blackout drunk she can't trust her own memory.

We later learn Tom is a huge liar and Megan almost word for word insults Anna and Evie the way the email did. Both things made me think it would be revealed that Tom (somehow) made that email or something, especially since this book always got compared to ""Gone Girl"" which had similar evidence planting. But this is never touched on later, ever.

It wasn't the most fantastically written book but maybe I just missed something?",0
"If you’re looking for beautiful pride and wicked characters.... Read “Laughter In the Dark” by Vladimir Nabokov, same writer as “Lolita”. Once again, he proves that his writing is so bewitching that even the most horrendous acts someone can commit sounds better.

The contrast of how evil the characters are to his beautiful writing is astounding. I devoured this book and honestly liked it better than Lolita (just my opinion).",1
"Rendezvous With Rama by Arthur C.Clarke As the title suggests I've just finished it and had a good time. It's my 3rd time reading clark and as impressed by the sense of wonder and scale.

My only criticisms if I had one was the incident with the missile. I felt the book already had enough action and adventure so that part felt tangential.

Still as I said very enjoyable and looking forward to trying his other stuff. But apparently not the Sequels or anything he co wrote in his later years.",1
"What's your favorite subversion of a chapter title? Spoiler alert for the Count of Monte Cristo:

>!One of my absolute favorite chapters is called The Graveyard of the Chateau d'If. The book has been building towards a prison break when Edmund's co-conspirator suddenly dies and changes everything. Instead of tunneling through the wall, Edmund realizes that he can switch places with the corpse, get buried in the graveyard outside the prison and dig himself up using one of his makeshift tools. What follows is an incredibly tense few pages in which he takes Abbe out of the sack they use to move bodies, takes his place inside and gets carried out by two men while pretending to be dead. Both he and the reader are waiting for him to be buried, waiting for his grand escape, waiting in suspense until...!<

>!The weighted sack he's sewn into is thrown off a massive cliff and into the water.!<

>!The last words of the chapter are ""The graveyard of the Chateau d'If is the sea.""!<

That's obviously a big, shocking moment and the way it differs from what you thought was coming is amazing. Considering how chapter titles innately create expectations, subverting them or assigning surprising meanings like above is a great writing tool. Recently, I read the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the last chapter also does an amazing job of doing this a very sad and tragic way. I was wondering what other examples of this trope you've enjoyed and which novels use it for similar effect?",1

"Thoughts About The Book of Longings? To the people who have read The Book of Longings by Sue Monk Kidd, how did you feel about it? Especially to the Christians who read the book? 

I’m not too religious. In fact I consider myself a bit of an agnostic, but I’m Catholic and went to a Catholic school and attended Christian living classes so I’ve had my share with Christianity. The book piqued my interest because it was about Jesus’ “wife.” And I was wondering how it was going to play out and if it would make me cringe but it became one of my favorite books. 

Just loved how it was written and how Jesus was not portrayed as a glorified miracle maker but a relatable human being who was devoted to his faith. And really the focus is on the female protagonist for the most part and she was very inspiring for me. I learned so much of the culture of their time and if I hadn’t known about Jesus, it would’ve read like a historical fiction book with a religious theme and some romance.  

I find it hard to talk about this book with some of my  friends. I got a few devout Christian friends and the whole concept of Jesus having a wife, even if it were fictional, might be too controversial for some people. So wanted to see how everyone else felt about it on here! :)",1

I’ve read opinion and review articles on the book, some are obsessed and others call it “trauma porn”. Curious what others here feel about it?",1
"The Yellow Ranch left me completely flummoxed https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/books/a32842446/kali-fajardo-anstine-short-story-the-yellow-ranch/

> a photography grad student named Tasha accepts a mysterious invitation—offered to her by a wise and handsome professor—to stay and work at El Rancho Amarillo, a secluded adobe house in Colorado's San Luis Valley. There, she hopes to reconnect with her indigenous heritage, but what seems too good to be true usually is.

> A creeping sense of dread pervades the first half of this story before shifting to full-on terror. Fajardo-Anstine deftly upends the tropes of a haunted house narrative while weaving together a frightening fable of exploitation.

Listed as a “scary story,” this short story is about a haunted house by Kali Fajardo-Anstine. I enjoyed the atmosphere and felt the house projected an air of warmth and nurturing. However, this is supposed to be a haunted house story thematically (indeed, the house has thoughts) and I cannot for the life of me understand who/what the house is haunted by and what the abrupt ending means. Or rather, I can glean the house remembers the previous inhabitants, but I don’t understand the weight of that, or the ending. I don’t get a sense of dread or really exploitation either, except maybe, predictably, between the (adult) student and teacher. I see Tasha is lost and making bad life decisions, but none of it instills terror. I would love to hear other people’s takeaways.",0

How does she smooth over their forgettance when they come out of the bathroom?

"What did you think of Stella Maris by Cormac McCarthy I just finished Stella Maris by Cormac McCarthy. Last month I read The Passenger. 

I wasn't overly keen on The Passenger. It was good, but it was certainly a departure from McCarthy's previous work. He still toyed with similar themes, but it just didn't grab me like some of his previous work did. 

Stella Maris, however, has me sort of spellbound. The structure of the story is such that a hyper-intelligent young lady is having a conversation with her therapist within a mental institution. It read like what I imagine an internal dialogue of the author might sound like, with deep and thoughtful questions about morality, life, meaning, existence, etc. 

Thematically, it aligns well with other McCarthy works, which I enjoy, but the structure is quite different that much of his previous work. 

It is much shorter than The Passenger--than any other McCarthy work I recall reading. But it is poignant and powerful, and has me mystified. I'm rolling it over in my head, and I suspect I will be for a while, which is one thing I like about McCarthy.

Another series I like is the King Killer Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss. That series has a short story included, which many deem number 2.5 of the larger (aspirational) trilogy. ""The Slow Regard of Silent Things"" is one of my all time favorite reads. I have read, and re-read it numerous times. It is weird and a bit difficult to follow, but for me it holds a beautiful substance, akin to a religious texts. When I read it, I get the impression that I am reading about the secrets of life and they are slowly unraveling before me. 

That is the feeling I got when reading Stella Maris--that there was some essence of life's deeper meaning wrapped up in the story--in the words. **There is a lot to consider and having just finished it, I am just curious who else has read it and what is your opinion of the work, not only as a standalone piece, but also as it relates to The Passenger, and the larger body of McCarthy's work**.",1
"Oof just finished “Endurance: Shackleton’s Incredible Voyage” by Alfred Lansing and what a testament to human strength and willpower. This book was a page turner. The tale of how this party of 27 men got stuck in the Wendell Sea and made it out alive with basically everything that could go against them going against them, is such a crazy story that really made me appreciate the comfort of my couch and warm blanket I got to read this book from. The book is non fiction but reads like a novel just because of how ludicrous it seems that this band of men were able to escape by the skin of their teeth. The grit and endurance they had to have to live on ice and ocean for TWO years with nothing but seal blubber and limited rations really makes you appreciate the simple comforts in life. It was definitely a grind watching the two steps forward, one step back progress unfold, but well worth the anxiety. I also really appreciated how high the spirits of these men were able to be maintained through deliberate action on Shackleton’s part and also man’s ability to adapt to the conditions given to us. I definitely recommend this book and will be gifting it this Christmas!",1
"Thoughts on Sanderson's ""The Emperor's Soul"" Hello, y'all! On this subreddit and many others, Brandon Sanderson is often suggested frequently. I myself hadn't read him at all, and hadn't planned to, as I typically don't go for sprawling world-building and complex magic-systems. However, I heard his novella ""The Emperor's Soul"" was a particularly good book of his and was more on the character-driven side relative to his other works, so I thought I'd give it a go.

Wow! It's very short, only a bit over a hundred pages if I recall correctly, but I practically devoured it in a single day. I can see why Sanderson is so popular, his prose is nothing special but it flows smoothly and stays out of the way, letting his relatively well-fleshed-out worlds and ideas shine through. I really enjoyed his character sketch of Shia, our protagonist in ""The Emperor's Soul"", and found some of the ideas he lightly touches on in the work to be thought-provoking as well as page-turning! I do think some stuff was a bit too trope-y for me to want to dive into more of his sprawling works, but I figured it would when I was going into it so I wasn't too taken aback.

But anyway was overall a really enjoyable read, and I'm glad I got around to reading it! I guess I have a thing for lesser-known works of very popular writers, especially ones where they break the mold and deviate from their tried-and-true formula a bit (although i guess I don't technically really know if this was the case for ""The Emperor's Soul""). I'd definitely suggest this books to anyone who likes contemporary fantasy, especially since it's short enough to be read in a single sitting.",1
What’s a book that’s either really underrated or not talked about enough ? For me Esperanza rising (Esperanza Renace ) by Pam Ryan I read it in Spanish first since my first language is Spanish and it takes place in a Spanish speaking town (I assume since it has a lol of Mexican culture) and then read it in English it’s talked about but not enough and it’s really underrated in my opinion,1

"A few book suggestions for the numb/depressed empath who wants to feel something. Trigger warning: Most if not all of these books are disturbing.

I’ve had a hard time finding books that make me feel some emotion while also keeping my attention. Not sure if there are any more of you out there but if so:

Little Peach by Peggy Kern

About a 14 year old with an awful home life who finds herself involved with a gang that sells her into prostitution. A very short read (about 200 pages), read it in a couple hours, kept my attention and made me feel all the emotions. The blurb in the back made me tear up a bit.

The Sluts by Dennis Cooper

Always a warning for anything Dennis Cooper: This is very sexually violent and disturbing. I thought the way this was written (email/instant message format) was actually super entertaining. A bit of a modern day mystery and very creative in the most vile way.

Baby Teeth by Zoje Stage

If you’re a parent this one will really reach you. About a mother who’s daughter acts perfect around her husband and like a little devil around her. The mother goes crazy because no one will believe her regarding the behavior of her daughter, including her husband. Explores mental illness, parenting styles. Leaves you confused on who to feel bad for.

The Butterfly Garden by Dot Hutchison

About a crazy, rich older man and his two sons, who kidnap or “collect” young girls, tattoo butterfly wings on their backs and keep them in the father’s private greenhouse against their will. Told from the perspective of one of their captives. Kept surprising me, explores the varying types of predator. Can’t decide which of the three men are the worst.

This is basically my reading style, if anyone likes it I’d be happy to recommend more. 🥲",1
"I just finished “The Secret History” for Book Club, and it has made me want to get back into reading as a consistent hobby I am a senior in high school, and I will admit that I am not an avid reader. I have started reading more often this school year - Stephen King novels, specifically - but “The Secret History” (which is 559 pages) is the longest novel I have read to date. It was a page turner - I will admit that I was partly motivated to finish it so quickly due to the fact that the date of the book club meeting was approaching, but I also found it to be one of the first books I’ve enjoyed in a long while. It reminded me of The Great Gatsby, and of “The Stranger” by Albert Camus (I suppose that I can’t explain how and why it reminds me of the latter book without spoiling it.) I found it to be well written and actually learned new vocabulary terms along the way. Reading it has given me the push to go to the library this weekend, and obtain a new library card. I have not used my library card in 7 years. But reading “The Secret History” and Stephen King novels - reading books that I actually enjoy, books wherein I am engrossed in the world of the characters, where the narrator disgusts and yet fascinates me all the same… it has made me want to read as much as I can in my coming years. I desire the pleasure of reading a good book moreso than I desire to study for my courses. I have a newfound love of reading.",1
"Confused about No Longer Human I just began reading it and I'm really confused. I understand why he might not understand others and how their hypocrisies and the fear of not knowing what to say. I just don't understand what he means by his happiness was very different to others or how he never felt hungriness? Why did he go out of his way to eat as much as possible in other people's houses but then dreaded dinner time, sure it might have been awkward and tense but it doesn't sound that horrible. Why did he dislike extravagance when he found they had a purpose e.g. the pillow designs or the bridge, perhaps because he felt like he himself didn't have purpose and had to decorate himself with empty fake smiles to appease others - but that seems like a stretch. He's a kid, it's so confusing that he didn't want a toy or a gift why did nothing make him happy? I feel really stupid and confused?  


Edit : Now further reading, I have more questions - why is he so desperate to fit in when in reality he wants to be left alone? He goes out of his way to please people and get people to like him, which will very well attract more attention which is something he wants the least. ",0
"A Valid Prequel to Jurassic Park by by Michael Crichton As we all know Michael Crichton has brought dinosaurs back to life in his two Jurassic Park books, how ever I suggest despite being released at a later date his book Dragon Teeth serves as an excellent prequel to Jurassic Park.

For those who have not read it, it is a historical fiction with several actual events and persons within the story. However it follows the life of the fictional William (Foggy) Johnson is a student at Yale college. Reckless and risk-taking, he makes a bet with his rival, a student named Marlin, that he will go west the following summer. Johnson then attempts to join Prof. Othniel Charles Marsh on his yearly expedition fossil hunting in the Badlands. Marsh is reluctant until Johnson lies, saying that he is a photographer. Johnson learns to take photographs and leaves with Marsh at the appointed time. However, upon learning of Johnson's Philadelphia background, Marsh begins to suspect that he is a spy for Edward Drinker Cope, a rival paleontologist. Marsh abandons Johnson in Cheyenne. Shortly thereafter, Johnson meets Cope, who invites him to join his expedition.

I don't want to go into more of the story because it is an intriguing read, and highly suggest it to all who have a chance to read it.",1
"I finally finished the Three Body Trilogy and holy moley I've never read hard sci-fi before and started this series earlier the year. I finished book 1 and 2 in quick succession and put off the 3rd until recently. Holy shit. Each book had a completely different theme and hurt my peasant brain with science terms. I've only been reading as a hobby for the past 2 years and this is one of the larger undertakings of my reading career to date (I don't count The Expanse series since I still have 3 books to go) and my mind is blown.

I know these are highly rated on Goodreads but how did you like the series? The third book blindsided me many times. I hope that the TV series will do it justice.",0
"The White Tiger - Thoughts/Opinion I read The White Tiger by Arvind Adiga a little while ago and thought it would be a good book for my first post here.

Rating: 8/10

Every country has its flaws, and my country India too. And the story revolves around it and explores these flaws and how it effects the people from the poorest class, their psychology and how they overcome these problems.

The story revolves around a boy Balram, who comes from a very small village in Bihar and is born to a poor farming/labourer family. At a young age he learns that world is hard and cold and if you don't fight, they will suck your life out of you, just what he saw happen to his father. At school, he was the smartest and was called The White Tiger, a rare being among the commons, one in a hundred by a school inspector and, he takes it to heart.

I won't go further in the story as it would start with the spoilers. The story continues as he struggles in the hard and cold world, slowly rising, learning the ways of the corrupt, despising how he needs to bow and kiss the feet of the rich to survive. All the experiences change him slowly and as he adapts to world around him, he really does become The White Tiger, a person from the poorest of the poor rising to success.

The story is presented in a first-person letter format (I don't have the correct term to explain it) as Balram writes letters in night, writing about his life to a Chinese businessman. The writing is course and not refined, but that is the whole point. Balram never got education, never studied English properly and the writing feels coming from a person who was stripped away from his education at a young age.

The story does get a little boring near the middle part, but it is not really that bad.

Highly recommend it.",1
"Books that hurt you Have you ever read a book that really hurt you? Like, made you feel like a terrible person?  
I guess I'm thinking mostly of non-fiction, self help-ish types of books.

Years ago, back when I was more of a conservative Christian believer, my sister, mom, and I did a book study together. We read What's It Like To Be Married To Me? by Linda Dillow and we met once per week via Skype to talk about it. ([https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10294367-what-s-it-like-to-be-married-to-me](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10294367-what-s-it-like-to-be-married-to-me))

According to this book, I'm a horrible person who expects way too much from my partner (I was married when I read it, but am now divorced and living with a new partner - I wonder what the author would think of THAT!). And during our conversation one day, my mom all but said that she thinks I'm a terrible person for wanting to have a job outside of the home - and I don't even have kids!

Yes, I realize that a big part of this issue is/was the conservative Christian beliefs about women and their roles in the home and society. But the book sure didn't help. 

Have any of you read anything like this, that made you want to cry/scream/rip the book apart?",0
"Finished Morning Star and Iron Gold by Pierce Brown. The thing I like most about Brown’s books are the twists and turns. You may think one thing is going to happen, but something entirely different occurs. A character may die, but did they really? A friend may turn into an enemy, but is that true? 

Morning star:
It is a shame that Ragnar died. I liked his character; Darrow’s shadow. It is always a good thing for authors to create a plethora of characters, that way it is easy to kill one off. Unfortunately, the ones that we like are the deaths that hurt the most. It is interesting to think about what would have happened later in the book if that character would have lived. The other thing I like about his books is that something is always happening. Not like slower-paced books that spend chapters over description. Overall, this book was great. You got something for everyone. Gore, deaths, strategies, betrayals, surprises, and more. Did not see that happening with Mustang, though. 

Iron Gold:
I just finished reading this book, so it is fresher in my mind. This book was just as good as the others. I liked this book a little more because it has multiple point of views. That gives the author more leeway into creating twists and turns and surprises, instead of just one linear story. We start with a time jump; Darrow’s older. I am okay with that. It lets the author tell us what happened in those years throughout the book. It also allowed Brown to let the children have a part to play. Once again, characters that people may like get cut away; which is to be expected. I hope that Lyria’s story did not end and that it was a false death. Her perspective was interesting. 

I am looking forward to reading Dark Age. I am going to guess that Victra will probably die; since every book has some main characters get killed. She is one of the main characters that has made appearances in multiple books, but is not that important to the overall series. I like that he includes Roman and Greek mythology for the names of places and people. 

What are your opinions on one or both of these books?",1
"The Talented Mr. Ripley: Book vs. Film (SPOILERS FOR BOTH) (TW: Murder, Homophobia)

This is going to sound like I'm rambling because I haven't quite collected my thoughts, but it's late so I want to get it out before I go to sleep. You can skip to the last paragraph if you just want to read what my thesis point is, and if it interests you then you can read the rest.

About a week ago I saw a Showtime promo that had a bunch of clips from different movies advertising their subscription service. One of the clips was Matt Damon and Jude Law on a boat looking very tense, and for some reason it caught my eye. During the clip, the title The Talented Mr. Ripley popped up on the screen, so I decided to look it up. I had already decided to watch the movie, however, upon finding out it was also a book, I decided to go that route first.

And wow, I honestly loved it. Took me two sessions to finish the whole thing. It's super suspenseful, dark, intriguing, and the latter half of the book had me on the verge of a panic attack. Tom is a terrifying sociopath and serial killer, without any sign of remorse and he rarely gives a second thought about his victims/crimes. Although on occasion he does express a desire to have handled things differently, it's based out of his wanting to escape responsibility, not remorse. Despite this, a lot of people, myself included, occasionally root for Tom over the ""system"" and bad-faith actors that have driven Tom to his deeds. It's a brilliant book to me for exactly this reason. There's no logical reason to root for Tom, who acts 100% selfishly and does nothing to redeem himself ever throughout the entire novel, yet the reality is we do root for him. There's something universal in his dilemma that makes him some sort of Holden Caulfield-esque antihero.

Okay fast forward to about 3 hours ago, I've got some time to kill and I decide to watch the movie. The movie starts out skipping the very first scene in the book. That scene in the book is Tom evading an unknown stalker, and clearly shows that Tom frequently feels paranoid that people are following him. This paranoia is a general theme all throughout the book, and is just not included whatsoever in the movie. Tom is shown as upbeat, motivated, and happy, instead of lazy, jobless, and emotionally dysfunctional. When Tom gets to Italy (he's been hired by a rich shipyard owner to go to Italy and convince his son to come home), he meets Dickie(the son) and his girlfriend Marge. In the book Marge almost immediately dislikes Tom, treats him like a weirdo, and makes repeated comments about how Tom is always around Dickie. She goes as far as to call him a homosexual and therefore a sexual deviant. She wants desperately for Dickie to force Tom to leave and views him as a horrible influence and person. In the movie, she becomes Tom's friend. Throughout the first hour of the movie, over and over, Marge goes out of her way to protect Tom and his feelings and chastises Dicky when he's insensitive. It's baffling and really doesn't make sense in the larger context of the story. 

Now the murder. This was the most mind-boggling part for me. In the book, upon receiving some bad news, Tom decides to murder Dickie and steal his identity. Essentially, Dickie is disinviting him from a group trip and telling him he should probably head home. Tom concocts a plan to get Dickie on to a boat so that he can do his murder and hide the body. There is some weird tension on the boat and Tom notes that Dickie doesn't seem to want to be friends anymore. Dickie stares away from Tom out the back of the boat and Tom smashes him on the side of the head with an oar. Then he does so over and over again until Dickie is bleeding everywhere and basically dead. In the movie, however, Tom and Dickie are having a great time and decide to go out on the boat together for fun. Dickie delivers the bad news to Tom while they're on the boat and an argument ensues. Dicky gets up and threatens to hit Tom, slaps him around a little bit in the face, and then verbally abuses Tom until Tom snaps and hits him with the oar. I can't say enough how confused I was. This is not the story. Tom is not some happy go lucky guy who has to fight and kill for survival. He is supposed to be a master manipulator, a sociopathic serial killer. Why did they so drastically alter this story??? 

The acting was fantastic and this story was good, but it was a different story than the book. It was not The Talented Mr. Ripley and I was deeply disappointed. Anyway, that is all. Thanks for reading if you did, and I love to hear some feedback from people because I know a lot of people loved the movie.

TL;DR- Read the book, loved it. Watched the movie, and despite it being a really well-acted movie, was super disappointed because the story is totally different. The story from the movie is not the story from the book.",1
"In the middle of reading Fledgling by Octavia E Butler and having some trouble So far this is my  4 book by her and I really enjoy her as an author and this book is definitely well written and interesting. The trouble is with the age of the main character. Not a spoiler cause it's in the blurb on the back of the book but she's a vampire and she's 53 but she looks 10 years old.

 That's not bad but it's the fact that she does grown woman things. It's hard to read how she kisses grown men and women and they have sex with her and crave her touch etc. I'm getting through it by imagining her as like 18 and just being short. I'm gonna finish the book cause I'm halfway and I do like the book but I see why others couldn't get through it.

 I'm no stranger to weird books (I enjoyed Lolita) but this being from Shori's POV makes it a bit easier since she isn't technically being taken advantage of. I was just curious to see if this affected anyone else that was reading and if any of you experienced this with other books.",0
"Curtain and Sleeping Murder Speaking of Agatha Christie, as this group often does, I've just reread Curtain - the final Poirot that she wrote in the 1940s and then tucked away. It was only published near her death. I recall it being not very good - and it's not. Uninteresting characters, poorly does Hastings viewpoint, nothing clever (with a single exception) Surprising, since she was at the top of her game when she wrote it.

On the other hand, Sleeping Murder, the last Miss Marple, is quite good.",0
"The Witches plot hole (Repost) (Repost from r/RoaldDahl) Something I noticed while reading *The Witches* by Roald Dahl. I realized that if the boy put the mouse maker in the soup, wouldn’t someone who also ordered the same soup be turned into a mouse, even if they weren’t a witch? There were 200 witches, so it could be that was just enough for only the witches, but if the cooks could make soup for 200 people, wouldn’t they use any leftovers for other customers? Is this a possibility? ",0
"Just finished reading Bones & All Dear god I thought it was so bad. It was absolutely one of those rare cases where movies are better than books. The protagonist was hard to like and relate to because she was so plain, the characters felt dimensionless and I had barely any idea what any of them looked like(and generally that wouldn’t matter if their characters were described better) and the book felt plain and unrealistic. The lord could’ve easily been delved into in a more fleshed out(no pun intended) way, and the concept itself could’ve made for a really bone chilling great horror drama but instead I feel like I just read a bad creepypasta. Also the characters motives, desires, and all around presences failed to make sense or capture me. It was a short book and it left almost too much to the imagination. I thoroughly disliked it. I was hoping for a lot more if there was a whole movie adaptation and praise over tiktok. Ugh.",0
"Has anyone read Exit by Belinda Bauer? I started this a couple of days ago, I'm only on chapter six and trying to decide if I want to continue.

The scene where Felix and the newest recruit, Amanda finish with their job and are leaving only to be stopped by the person they were supposed to see confused me.  Why were the papers and the canister in the room with the wrong person to begin with?  

I am having a hard time getting past that point, right now the police are at the house investigating and my mind keeps going back to why were the items in the wrong room to begin with?

So is this explained in a way that makes sense to the reader or is it a question left hanging the remainder of the story?",0
"Out of the Dark by David Weber Ok spoiler if you haven’t read it. It was an oddly enjoyable book so if you’re interested in sci-fi and may want to read it I don’t want to ruin it for anyone.

Ok that said, I liked the book but what’s up with the ending? Everything was straight forward aliens invading Earth. I like how the politics for the invasion were laid out and the reasons for the difficulties the aliens had. But to just tada vampires in at the end totally stunned me. Like military sci-fi the whole book then bam vampires! I haven’t read the second book and I’m not sure what to expect.",1
"Question concerning Victor Frankenstein and fevers I just finished an audiobook of Frankenstein and overall I enjoyed it very much, and I've kept thinking about it for the last few days. One question that lingers in my mind is probably mostly concerned with medical history, but I'll give it a go here.

Several times Victor Frankenstein is inflicteded with fevers, usually immediately following some significant and emotionally important event in the story. These fevers usually renders Frankenstein bedridden or even unconsious for months at a time, and one time he only recognized the nurse (who had cared for him for two months already) by her voice, as this was all that he remembered from the months of illness. Was this something that would regularly occour back in the 19th century or earlier? Did people become bedridden with fevers for months at a time after periods of emotional distress?

P.S. slapping on a spoiler tag for this 200yo classic just to be safe.",1
"Anxious People: Backman has done better but... I'm about to finish this longish ramble.  I think Backman is trying too hard to be funny. Granted, when he's on target he can split your sides and make you cry. 

And that alone may be enough reason to hang in. I just wish every character didn't feel like a stand up. 

Even so, the writing is polished and focused like this

""We exchanged books. Until he died a few years later. Something to do with his heart. His siblings put the apartment up for sale, but his furniture was still there at the viewing. 

So I went along, pretending to be interested in buying it. I walked around in his home, ran my hands over his kitchen counter, the hangers in his closet. In the end I found myself standing in front of his bookcase.

 It’s such an odd thing, the way you can know someone so perfectly through what they read. We liked the same voices, in the same way. So I let myself have a few minutes to think about what we could have been for each other, if everything had been different, somewhere else in our lives.""

So I can heartily and hesitantly say it's worth reading.",1
"Grabbing a book to reread particular scenes On Youtube there are countless videos of clips from movies or tv shows broken out on their own to enjoy over and over.

Still got chills even without re-reading the whole book.

"Do you quit halfway through? I'm currently reading The Rivers of War by Eric Flint. It's an alternate history novel set during the War of 1812. I'm a great fan of Flint, especially his 1632 universe. For Rivers, I just don't care. Everytime I open the book I feel like I'm trudging through the pages so that I can finish and go on to something else. I've made it through distasteful books. I've read books I've actively hated but wasn't going to not finish as an act of defiance.

I feel like opening a book implies some sort of contract between reader and author. The author promises to tell a story or impart information to the reader and the reader promises to listen to the story.

I'm finding it more difficult to make it through a book I'm approaching with antipathy. So my question is, under what circumstances do you personally quit partway through?",0
"Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler is probably the most real-feeling dystopia I've ever read. As an example of how accurately it portrays societal movements - in the sequel (written in 1998) there is a Christian nationalist presidential candidate in the US. Wanna guess his election motto? Yep. 'Make America Great Again'. I absolutely could not believe it when I saw it in a book written more than 20 years ago.

I've read a lot of dystopian sci-fi books, and this is definitely the one that feels most real. Everything doesn't go to hell overnight - instead, people lose more and more trust in the system, and the more that happens, the more the decline accelerates. Everyone isn't transformed into some kind of hyper-violent murderer by the collapse - most people still want rules and safety. But when an armed gang shows up, or a bunch of people on a psychosis inducing drug, those moments are incredibly tense and dangerous.

Here's the setup for the 1st book (no spoilers, but in tags in case you like to go in blind):  >!It’s the year 2025, and United States is descending into anarchy in the face of climate change and other disasters. We see the world through the diary entries of Lauren Olamina, a teenager living in a walled-in neighborhood in the exurbs of Los Angeles. Jobs are scarce, food and water are increasingly expensive, and armed gangs and drug addicts control the streets outside. !<

>!Lauren’s father, a pastor and professor at a local college, tries to keep their little community safe, but Lauren feels things going to pieces and is always preparing for things to get worse. When it all comes crashing down, will she be ready? !<

It also has a really interesting internal philosophy / religion created by the main character (called Earthseed). It uses that philosophy as an extremely novel way to explore religion more generally and its positive and negative impacts on individuals and society.

I'll say that normally I'm not a YA fan, but this is book that really highlights the best parts of YA writing without a lot of the things that make me crazy. We get to see the world through a young woman's eyes, we know how she feels and what she is struggling with, but its not overly melodramatic. It also breaks a few standard YA plot 'rules' in really excellent ways.

The author, Octavia Butler, is also an extremely cool lady. She was the first scifi writer to win a McArthur genius grant, the first black woman to win the Nebula award, and is widely credited as one of the primary progenitors of the Afrofuturism movement.

"Rebecca- What do you think of Mrs de Winter and Maxim’s relationship? I love Rebecca and have read it multiple times at various ages and have always found myself debating Maxim and narrator’s marriage. The first time I read it when I was young I adored their relationship but as I got older and read critiques I found myself considering that he belittles her and is somewhat neglectful even though he might care for her. No matter how much I think about this book I can never quite decide. 

So what do people think about their relationship, and Maxim? Does he genuinely care for narrator or does he love her? Or does he just want company? Also is Maxim the real villain, especially considering what he does to Rebecca?",1
"Finished reading Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes for the first time! Heartbreaking, and hauntingly beautiful. To preface this, I’d like to say that I’m days away from graduating from occupational therapy school where I will soon plunge into a career of working with disabled children. A while back I asked for OT book recommendations on another sub, but little did I know that this fictional work would be just what I was looking for. 

Reading this book gave such a unique perspective into the mind of a disabled adult. Granted, it’s not meant to be a scholarly work, but it does a good job of capturing the emotions and other people’s perspectives towards disability. How they feel towards Charlie as an intellectually disabled guy and how they feel towards him when he becomes smarter. (Ironically, still intimidated by him but now in a different way). Charlie realizing his friends were not really his friends was so heartbreaking too. 

One of my favorite parts is when Charlie visits the Warren Institution and we get this quote: “What an incredible thing! How much less they had than other human beings. Mentally retarded, deaf, mute— and still eagerly sanding benches.”

The ending is also so sad, but in a poetic sort of way I think it was beautiful as it tied the book together, kind of saying that ultimately we cannot play God. What were your thoughts?",1
"Thirteen at Dinner/Lord Edgware Dies What does everyone think of this classic Christie?

I hadn’t re-read it in some time and think it’s a wonderful example of the joy of reading mysteries! It’s inventive, funny, clever, and a smashing conclusion! The slight suspension of disbelief you might need at any point in the story didn’t impair my pleasure at all.",1
"American Psycho: What am I missing? Why is this considered a good book? I recently read American Psycho as I have never seen the movie, and it’s in so many memes these days. I figured I would read the book first since it is critically acclaimed to some extent, and I generally try to read books first. 

But now, after reading the book, I don’t even want to watch the film. The book was kinda funny at first, the obsession with fashion and dinner reservations was funny the first 5-6 times, I even laughed out loud, but that comedy wore off halfway through the book. 

I know this book is supposed to be provocative, however the book starts to get just plain old disgusting towards the back half. I don’t considered myself “sensitive” by today’s standards, but the constant graphic sexual violence and slurs felt gratuitous. 

It really was somewhat disturbing in some scenes, and I thought I had become numb to violence from playing so many stupid video games with excessive gore. 

By the last 30% of the book, I was ready for it to be over. I personally would not recommend anybody read this book as I don’t think the graphic physical and sexual violence in this book is worth reading.

What am I missing here? Am I totally missing the point of this book?",0
"The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy I shared my thoughts on ""The Road"" a while back, and after being recommended ""The Crossing"" by a fellow Redditor, I thought I'd post a follow-up. 

I'll start as bluntly as possible. The Road gutted me like a cold, dry fish. I loved it from start to finish and hated it for the way it made me feel, and that is quite a rare combination. I'll also likely never forget that book. Still, after hearing about The Crossing, I was understandably excited. It wouldn't be the same, sure, but I had high hopes for more in the way of subtle human desperation and raw emotion. Thus, I jumped straight in and got to it. 

I'll be honest, the first fourth of the book had me hooked. I felt for the boy. I felt for his struggles, his anxiety, his faux masculinity, and the wolf by his side. I'm a firm believer that if the reader knows something bad's coming, but they don't know when then you're doing dread a great service. The Crossing, however, wasn't that. Sure, the wolf died, fast, relatively painlessly, and in a way, beautifully. Then, more purple prose and self-masturbatory wordsmithery than I've ever read, ever, combined. I had to stop after a good twenty pages and think about what was happening. Was there a message buried beneath this torrent of ""a man is only as worthy as his X"" tangents? A bunch of tragic and thoughtful metaphors perhaps? Because come on, surely this story can't simply devolve into minor story beats accompanied by string after string of further ""a life worth living isn't an X"" cleverness? Sadly, yes. Yes, it did. 

I tried to love this book, and at first, I did. Don't get me wrong, it's not poorly written. It's purple, definitely, and I'm fine with that. But there's just something self-serving about it, to a distracting extent. It's like a poem that draws intrigue from your very soul only to continue waxing depth while trying to impress you for another 1900 lines. How I thought, how can I care about these boys so deeply, and so quickly, only to wish they'd reach a destination, an ending, anything significant before I strangle them with my own hands? 

I'd love to discuss the book. I didn't care for it in the end, but that's why I'm here. 

Finally, I'm aware that The Crossing is part of a trilogy.",0
"Feeling guilt for not finishing (deceased) friend's favorite series So this has been eating at me for **nearly a decade now**. Genuinely bothered by it and it is holding back my reading. Looking for some words of wisdom.

\-----

A close friend of mine - one of my few friends that I 'talked books' with - passed away shortly after high school. He would read books I recommended and vice versa. At the top of his fantasy list was ""The Dark Tower"" series by Stephen King. He always talked about it & so I read the first 3 books while he was still around...

Problem is that I never really loved the books, but since he's passed I feel like I have an obligation to finish the series. It is a really heavy feeling to think that you are disrespecting or not honoring the desires of a deceased friend. 

I am on book 4 out of 7, so I have 3.5 (includes a novella) to go. We're talkin' 600-800 page chunkers. 

The books aren't atrocious... but I am just plain-old *not interested* & have so many other series I desperately want to read. Reading it feels like a chore. Plus everyone says the ending is horrible. Every time I pick it up, I can't help but feel I'm wasting time on a mediocre series (sorry Dark Tower fans, I may have bad taste).

\-----

My mental roadblock won't let me start **ANY** new fantasy series until I complete this series or officially DNF (& burn from memory). 

Any advice on how to get rid of this guilt? Should I just spend 4-6 months finishing the stupid thing?",0

"Ghosts of my Life by Mark Fisher I was introduced to this book under the pretenses that it was a mentally heavy reading, and a lot of people regarding it as, 'Pro-Suicidal' material.  But while I was reading it, I didn't get that impression at all.   Sure it spends a lot of time, well I guess all of it, discussing how modern music, movies, and books are trapped in an either hidden or obvious trance of 'Forever lost'.  Which I guess can be interpreted as suicidal thinking but written in a way of contempt.  Though I do consider this under depressive writing, since he is obsessed with the idea that the future is something to either fear or dread.

So, needless to say, I didn't find this book nearly as depressing as I was led to believe it would be.  I had the same feeling the second time I read Osamu Dazias, No longer Human. (The first time was in middle school and I didn't get it at all)  Not that these two have any connections themselves, just that I didn't read them the same way everyone else said they read it.  

And I really appreciated all the views that Fisher had on all the media he covered, from the Caretaker and Joy Division and Burial, to The Shinning and Inception.  The idea that no matter where you are and what you try to be and represent, you will be haunted by the idea that things could have, and were possibly at one point in time, so much better.  And I will never forget his quote on depressives.  ""If there is one thing depressives are confident about, it's that they are under no delusions.""  I really felt that.

And I think a lot of people are going to roll their eyes at what I'm about to say, but while I was reading this I couldn't help but make connections to other depressive writings such as Kurt Vonnegut.  Though these two's depression are handled differently by the respective person.  While Fisher writes about all the hidden meaning and implications in modern day music and movies, how anything that is created now is only a reminder that things will never be as they once were but still willing to find all things beautiful in it.  Vonnegut writes as things are equally haunting but still willing to try and find ways to make it easier for the people around him.  Contrasting dim-lit epicureanism with contempt stoicism,  just putting their energies in different aspects of life and it's supposed lost meaning.  I don't think I explained that well, but that's just my attempt at sounding smart.

Anywho, I'd love to know what anyone else who has read this thinks.",0
"For fans of The Secret History.... Please read “The Historian” by Elizabeth Kostova. TSH is one of my favorite books and I’ve probably read about 15 books that people have said I should read after it and the only one that I really enjoyed was “Lake of Dead Languages” by Carol Goodman.

This book isn’t like TSH in the way that it’s in a school background or really dark academia, at least in the classic sense, but it’s dark and page-turning and very intricate, and also is a bit of mystery/thriller in a way but way more so literary fiction. 

I knew “The Historian” was going to be one of my new favorite books before I was even 1/3 of the way done. First of all, the plot is very interesting the entire thing is like an odyssey of two different journeys that intertwine. I’m usually not into that style of plot but this was executed so well.

The main character is so lovable and relatable and probably one of my favorite narrators I’ve ever read. Writing itself is superb, some of the lines in this book REALLY knocked me away and I’m a pretty big reader. 

I really recommend any huge fans of “The Secret History” to give this book a try.",1

I made a couple of trips from Italy to Romania carrying ""Fahrenheit 451"" by ray Bradbury, so travelling around 4000km with it. 

Sometimes I also read a few pages during lunch break. The book I carried the most in this case is ""Deception Game"" by Will Jordan, so around 2400km.",1
"I just finished ""The Lost"" and I'm mad [spoilers] Just finished The Lost by Natasha Preston, found it for Kindle unlimited and gave it a shot. The beginning was a bit too YA for me, but I kept going. It got good, in my opinion. However! The ending! I'm so mad!

I'm curious if anyone else has read it and what your opinions are about the book and istoryline?




---spoilers below---




The main ""bad guys"" are just sick rich ass holes with no motive or personality beyond that.

The main girl, piper, is a dumb and shouldn't need a man to be vulnerable with. Where is my bestie girl power? And what the heck is up with her friend? She just gave up and was suddenly barely a character? And she didn't even get tortured?!? WTF.

To be fair, I didn't see the big twist near the end. It surprised me. However, the car and conveniently open window B.S. at the very end is really ticking me off!

Am I too harsh? Am I just that out of touch with newer YA content/storylines?",0
"been in a bit of a reading rut lately- Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo 
Hi everyone - first time poster :)

So basically i have been in a HUGE reading slump I’ll admit for the last TWO YEARS ugh ! Hate to admit that .. all my life I’ve had a huge love of reading so i can’t believe I have been having such a hard time with this! The last book I got really into was Ready Player 2 back in 2021 .. I then immediately moved onto Circe but fell off and have not gone back.and sadly I read nothing during 22… until now - Anyways - last year for Christmas my dad gave me a gift card for B&N and I finally got my chance to go use it and wound up getting the Seven Wives of Eleanor Hugo. I’ll admit I did actually love it ! It was an easy read and Evelyns story kept me interested.I do think that I wish Monique’s storyline was elaborated or expanded on more somehow. I feel like the twist was kinda dropped on us last minute so I guess I think maybe it coulda happened earlier and dealt with more. But overall I am happy I got it and I feel like it’ll help move me of this slump. It also made me interested to read more by the author since I enjoyed the universe.So I also purchased The Great Alone- Kristin Hannah which I plan to start tomorrow . After that I may try to go back to Circe and I’ll be back on a kindle which is kinda sad cause I been loving having physical books for a change LOL. But I’m open to any suggestions also :) I don’t want to go back to Circe and get in a rut again so I want to have a plan B! I hope I like the Great Alone…",1
"Wanted to share one of the most powerful quotes I have ever seen - spoilers(?) for ""Reservation Blues"" by Sherman Alexie For context: alcoholism is a theme throught the book that the character ""Victor"" has dealt with a lot. He had decided to give up drinking (if I remember correctly), but at the end of the novel his friend Junior committed suicide, prompting Victor to habitually purchase more alcohol.

He opens a can of beer, and the author writes,

>""That little explosion of the beer can opening sounded exactly like a smaller, slower version of the explosion that Junior’s rifle made on the water tower.""

I enjoyed the book decently up to this point, but reading this line just completely gave me chills. Such an amazingly written line that highlights the horror of addiciton, and made me feel like I just got hit by a bus.",1
"Thoughts on Where The Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens A memorable, atmospheric story about Kya and her life in the marsh.

KYA:
Kya is such a memorable character. She'll live on in my heart forever. Such an underdog, I was rooting for her the whole time. I just wanted what was best for her, and by the end I see her as someone I would love to be friends with. She's such a free spirit and an inspiration to anyone facing overwhelming odds. Her passion for biology is infectious and made me certain that I want a career working with animals.

THE MARSH:
The marsh is essentially an entire character in itself. Pushing and pulling, pulsing to the beat of nature. Ever changing and in flux with life and death. The marsh almost steals the show.

THE WRITING STYLE:
Delia Owens is a natural at atmospheric writing. Sentences flow in style and beauty, and nature themed metaphors and wordplay is abound. From the first paragraph I was oohing and aahing at how poetic the sentences were. Very flowery and appropriate for this love letter to nature.

THE SECONDARY PLOT:
The book is first and foremost about Kyas life. The secondary plot being told is the death of Chase Andrews, which Kya is then pulled into as a suspect. I liked it. It was interesting. Court writing can be boring but Owens did it well, only keeping what was needed and not dragging it on. No complaints.

OVERALL:
Overall this is a heartbreaking story of an abandoned child who grows up with Nature as her new Mother. The writing is beautiful. Kya is loveable and a great main character. The secondary plot was interesting. The other characters were realistic and great additions. The tone was sad but hopeful. And the marsh was so full of life I feel like I've been there.
Amazing story and definitely worth a read.",1
"Thoughts on Good Omens by Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman I have a New Year's resolution to read more and visit the library more often. Every year, I start a resolution early to see if it will stick and make it a habit before the new year rolls around. I started out by reading Good Omens, a book that's been suggested to me by a few friends and I finally got around to reading and finishing it.

Overall impression is positive! It was a page turner for sure and I liked *most* of the characters, Crowley and Aziraphale chiefly. Before this, about a year ago, I read American Gods by the same author and I can see many similarities which was a lot of fun. There are some things I'd like to nitpick with you all if you would humor me...

The multiple viewpoints, especially in the last third of the book or so, were giving me whiplash. Crowley, Aziraphale/Mr. Shadwell/Madame Tracy, The Four Horsemen, Adam Young/the Them, and Newt/Anathema each had their own separate stories that intertwined with each other and that was great but sometimes each viewpoint only had a paragraph before bouncing to the next character's story. I don't mind this but it happened so much towards the end that it began to take the wind out of the climax's sails (for me. Keep in mind this post is just opinion).

The notes at the bottom of the pages were often hilarious but sometimes were a bit distracting. The writing was genius and there were times I looked forward to the little asterisks but towards the end there they sometimes felt like too much author interruption. Sometimes those little notes broke up the flow of the story a bit too much for my liking.

The concept of modern-day Four Horsemen of the apocalypse was awesome and I loved each one

Reading about the Them (i.e the son of Satan and his friends) felt very slow. I feel like I should be lenient here because, after all, the kid's 11 years old and the authors pretty much perfectly summed up 11 year old life and activities. But yeah, the 11 year old children's dialogue was so accurate that it was slightly painful sometimes. 

Absolutely loved how similar Crowley and Aziraphale were. Just two agents that were sent to do a job and though on surface level were opposites, both were just two sides of the same coin. I liked seeing how Crowley could be selfless and the moment Aziraphale cursed for the first time in 6,000 years.

Mr. Shadwell was a dick to Madame Tracey and didn't contribute all that much besides sending Newt on his mission to Lower Tadfield. I may be way off base here and if I'm missing something crucial then I'm terribly sorry.

So yes, all in all the above are fairly small things that I didn't love but overall the book was great. Really fun concept, witty writing and definitely entertaining. Let me know what you think!",1
"One moment that absolutely floored me in Anna Karenina Geez, I could go on and on about this book, but that entire short scene where Dolly and her kids are at their country house was pure brilliance. Her pride in dressing up her children, conflicted with her doubts about whether she is being a good parent to her kids or not. Two of her children sharing their pudding together leading to her joy at how wonderful they are, only for the same two children to have a bitter fight later in the day leading to her doubts about whether they will grow into good people. Culminating in an ultimately ambivalent but captivating image of parenthood.

I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful and realistic snapshot of the relationship between parent and child that freely embraces the the highs and lows, joy and pain, and general messiness mixed with beauty in parenthood. Heck, I don't even have children, but Tolstoy in his brilliance made me *feel* what a mother might feel.

God the whole book is just moments like these over and over (seeing your crush in public, hanging out at a party, self destructive denial when you realise someone you thought was a good person isn't actually a good person, meeting your annoying acquaintances, travelling on holiday), the book really is about timeless human experiences themselves - which is why its still as resonant today as it was in the late 1800s.

On a sidenote, does anyone have any opinions about the translations? I'm using the Maude version right now, but I've definitely heard the P&V translations might be better (even though I kind of enjoy the old english style of the Maude that gives it that 'classic' feel). Would it actually impact your enjoyment of the book all that much?",1
"Just started reading The Chronicles of Narnia(for reference, I'm 29)! I grew up watching the movies and have always wanted to read the books and I finally got around to it. I snagged the entire collection plus an essay by C.S Lewis all combined into one book on Thriftbooks for $20, completely brand new and I'm ecstatic! For those of you who have read the books, what are your thoughts? W/o giving me spoilers, are there things I should pay mind to or interesting things you wanna share about the book?",1
"What relatively unknown book do you feel deserves some buzz ? A book that makes you feel 'wow, more people need to experience this'? Mines is the 39 Clues series. I gave it a try because Shmoop had a guide on it (They usually only do books with some kind of cultural or critical popularity), I was surprised at how fun and readable it is (solid character dev/depth too), considering how relatively unknown it is. 

Out of all the genres of storytelling, (movies, tv, games, etc.), books have the most underrated stories due to each one having the most commitment. 

Is there a book you read that made you think  'wow, more people need to experience this'?",1
"Finished Fairy Tale by Stephen King. Question about it Finally finished Fairy Tale. It was definitely a slog at times, although I liked it overall. Easily could have shaven off 200 pages or kept the page count but cut the fluff and fleshed out some of the remaining storyline. The framework was there and I enjoyed some of the characters and ideas. And impressed King can still spin a yarn like this at this stage of his life and career.

Anywho, there was one aspect that was hinted at, or so I thought, in the first 1/3 of the book that never played out and was wondering what others thought of it:

>!When listening to the tape from Mr Bowditch before entering the portal, we hear the following on pg 173: ""Near this plaza is a huge sundial that must be a hundred feet in diameter. It turns, like the carousel in the novel. The Bradbury novel. I'm sure he....never mind, mind this instead: the sundial is the secret of my longevity....""!<

>!and then very shortly after: ""Charlie, I hate to think of sending you into the source of so many of our earthly terrors, and I won't order you, but the.......""!<

>!I thought for sure that Bowditch was hinting that this world was the source or inspiration of many of the stories we have here in our world. These two quotes seem to support some theory that Bradbury's novel was like a page out of this other world, and heck, the title of the book was 'Fairy Tale' and while the main character mused on some similarities between his experiences in Empis and some classic fairy tales he knows, those comparisons seemed forced and then the story ended without really touching on the idea again. I thought it was odd the main character ended up being a professor of Lit and Fairy Tales because his experience didn't really remind of a fairy tale much at all. It was a slight fantasy at most imo.!<",1
"J.D. Salinger = red flag? Why is it so common amongst book people to perceive it as a red flag if someone likes salingers books? I guess many people assume that if someone likes catcher in the rye, that person can identify with Holden caulfield?
In fact there are so many other books in which the protagonists are so much worse, that aren't seen as red flags, so I really don't get it",0
"The Poppy War - I don't often DNF books, but when I do, it makes me sad. I'm halfway into the book and realizing that the author has let me down. It's not the tropes or similarities to a few other well known fantasies. And it's not the violence or *not* YA, YA writing style because I don't mind YA. I've lost faith that the characters and story will develop and it will be 250 pages of boring battle scenes. Apologies to the author and fans. I've only DNFd just a few other books and I'm thinking of taking Babel off my reading list too. Does the story ""develop""?",0
"Ray Bradbury's prose is on another level!! Well, I started reading Fahrenheit 451 after a gazillion years of recommendations from my friends, and I'm loving it so far. What I've noticed however, is that even though the story is so damn good, I'm enjoying the prose equally if not more. The way he describes simple things put an unforgettable imagery in your head and I'd compare Bradbury to Oscar Wilde in that respect even though both have very different tendencies.

I also got around reading his short stories like The Pedestrian, The Veldt, A Sound of Thunder etc, and WHATTA GUY.

I also found out that he wrote Fahrenheit 451 on a typewriter, so he couldn't edit it and this blows my mind even though I don't know the actual details of this.

EDIT: Wow this got way more replies than I had imagined. Thank you all for the recommendations, i shall go into a reading spree!",1
"The little prince I was reading it in the middle of august and this book just affect me so so bad. I cried for hours after finishing this. My life was comletly different after that.

Have you read it? Just please, give little prince chance!🤍",1
"Thursday Murder Club mysteries I have just started The Man Who Died Twice (Richard Osman) and third chapter in, I am reminded of what I didn’t like about The Thursday Murder Club ….The “Joyce” chapters.

Does anyone enjoy these? What is their purpose? I bit of comic relief?

I often find they take me away from the flow of the story. And why is there specific Joyce POV chapters but the rest of the characters just have normal chapters?",0
"On Inheritance Games - the love triangle (full of spoilers) I’m not normally one for love triangles, but the one depicted in The Inheritance Games was really up my alley. I’ve noticed some discourse over the endgame being wJameson because many people preferred Grayson. As someone who really wanted Grayson and Avery to be endgame, I’m actually glad that Jameson was endgame. 

1) I’m happy that avery stuck to her choice. One thing that irks me is when characters just can’t choose who they want and play with both. Especially in this scenario when both boys were played by Emily, I really think it was important that Avery remained firm. It was to show that she wasn’t like Emily; she wouldn’t hurt either of them that way. She made a choice and she stuck to it. I believe that love is more than just a feeling and the series showcased it amazingly; it’s about choosing somebody again and again, and always choosing to love them. 

2) Grayson wasn’t ready. This is a fact that everyone can see, but he was grieving for Emily. He was hallucinating, he was not mentally stable, and he couldn’t have been a good partner for Avery anyways. Even at the end when he has ‘gotten over her’c trauma doesn’t just go away like that. You don’t get over your grief in an instant

3) Jameson was there throughout. He’s the one who spent more time with Avery. And as she said, he’s the one who made her who she was. Avery as a character wouldn’t be the same if not for him

Of course, this isn’t to say that Grayson shouldn’t have been endgame. I rooted for him the whole time and wanted to throw my book away every time he sided with Eve/ pushed Avery away. I felt that the chemistry between Avery and Jameson wasn’t as poignant the way it was between Avery and Grayson. 

But I can see why the author chose this route. But I will definitely be writing my own angst fanfics for Grayson moving forward because there’s so much that could’ve been explored with their explosive chemistry",1
"Ulysses - Joyce sabotages a nascent reader 

It was about 7 years ago that I fondly desired to read. And I mean everything, from Homer to ..Murakami! I wanted to start with the most remarkable books of all time, needing to fill my lack of literacy and take a breath in the air of the finest novelists. 

I immediately realized that the trip should have been very long and that it was impossible to take that excessively deep line because I was a bit late for such profoundness, already 33 years old. Then, as Zappa accurately quoted, ""So many books, so little time"". So the simple choice was to google the great lists, those with the all-timers! 

Since then I enjoyed reading, here there and everywhere!

Anyhow, for the 20th century, among Camus, Proust, Hesse, Hemingway, Kafka, Zola, Nabokov and others, my trip led me to the mighty James Joyce and his masterpiece, Ulysses. I have completed the first two chapters of the book and I dare to say, is a struggle. Calvary. It's impossible that this is the only read since I started, that puts me unceasingly to some tormenting, challenging and oblivious task. Invites me to perceive sensing into a gigantic system, rich in significant notions and approaches, even through simple words, that end up quite empty in my mind. Feels like it offers many straphangers to choose from but I can't grab a single one. 

Perhaps it's a matter of poor translation, hence I tested to read it in English but was more harmful. It is possible that this is not the correct book from Joyce's bibliography to start with. I repeatedly understand that reading is not just moving your eyes through the lines, but feeling intense emotions and satisfying your senses within the cosmos of the mastermind behind it. And I also experience that you have to be completely involved, to absorb whichever imaginative quality generously provides you.

 I gave all of myself to Ulysses, as hard as possible. That experience (let's overreact a little more) drops off part of my self-esteem. Let's put it simply. I feel stupid reading Ulysses. Maybe I am, why not?

So, I was wondering if I have to keep reading it because redemption is soon to be here, kind of ""have faith, my son!"" Or shall I put it in the ""freezer"" for a little while and step inside this pandemonium later in my reading career? Shall I start the James Joyce experience with some other work and then turn back to this one?",0
"12 Rules for Life: My Opinion Most psychology books are old wine in new bottles, rehashing the same ideas with a little twist or coat of fresh paint, pop truisms however, you’re missing out on a lot by not reading the book itself. The summary for the rules can be found anywhere on the internet but the benefit of reading a book like this is that each person can take something out of it that resonates the most with themselves. Most of the rules sound way too cryptic, unless you read it with the appropriate context that Dr. Peterson provides. You can also try the Audiobook that he has narrated himself on Audible.",1
"Allegory aside, the Narnia books are a masterclass in flawed characters and character development. I've rarely seen books that hit the mark of so many characters being treated fondly by the author, but still doing some really terrible things, and then finding their way around to getting it together and doing right again. It especially stands out in the Silver Chair where the characters are often fighting and both non-stop making mistakes and failing. Voyage of the Dawn Treader has most characters being tested and failing at some point, but realizing their mistakes and growing from them.

I know the Christian themes are unpopular here but they're really well done imo",1
