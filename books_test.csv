"1984 - Becoming less relevant? Just finished 1984 by George Orwell, good read. Definitely provides a terrifying dystopian future that seems possible. Many like to refer to 1984 as a prophecy of what is to come, or what is already here, the censorship and mass surveillance of the population. Certainly this is happening in countries like China and North Korea, but most of the people who liken 1984 to our current society are doing this specifically to the western world, or America. However, in my opinion, the America we live in is freer in the first amendment than ever. I believe we were much closer to the reality of 1984 before the book was even written. I  refer to the Espionage and Sedition acts of World War One which made disrespecting the country a crime, and people were often arrested and harassed if they displayed any nonconformity or not enough patriotism. Today, we find ourselves being surrounded by people spewing nazi nonsense (Kanye 😞) and the only governmental reprimand is an admonishment on twitter by the president. The only form of censorship we find in the US is that of private corporations, and not from the U.S. government. I do believe that 1984 is often misinterpreted, as it was more referring to the dangers of allowing a Hitler Germany, Stalin Russia, or Mao China, to exist. The U.S. is so divided a 1984 is not presently possible, as the government cannot even come together as in the book. Certainly there are some who would like this to happen, but often I find the same people who cite the very book are on the same side as the fascists who would institute similar policies as in Orwell’s book.  A note on the mass surveillance, which may be more present in society. It seems to me that many who like to throw a fit on censorship by private companies also would be conservatives who supported George Bush, who famously passed the Patriot Act, perhaps the largest program of government surveillance in history. When the government spies on people they don’t like, the fits are noticeably quieter. Private surveillance by companies like Amazon is also not very similar to 1984, as these companies want to see what you do so they can earn money, not kill you. Pretty much capitalism epitomized. All in all, I believe most of society has watered down this classic to “why can’t I be racist on twitter literally 1984”",1
"A nasty kind of high: ""A Scanner Darkly"" by Philip K. Dick. So tonight I've wrapped up reading Philip K. Dick's ""A Scanner Darkly"" and, well, I was taken on a mighty bizarre trip!

This novel, set in  a dystopic  California, revolves around a mind altering drug known as substance D (also known as death in the book). Substance D is not an ordinary drug, for it not only alters the mind but it literally splits it in half. 

And of course the two main characters, or should we say character. Fred a law enforcement officer who wears a camouflaging device known as a scrambler suit. And Bob Arctor a substance D dealer who also takes the drug himself. Fred actively pursues Arctor, but what they don't realize, as a result of the effects of substance D, they are both the same person and both become completely paranoid as time goes on. Bob avoids Fred while Fred avoids his own bosses.

This is how the Seattle Post-Intelligencer describes the book best,""Shot through with schizophrenia, paranoia and the inability to know what is real."" Can't argue with that! Philip K. Dick use of the concept of identity is very prevalent in this work and it works well.",1
"Just finished Things Fall Apart (Chinua Achebe) and I LOVED it I flew through this book in only three sittings. Not to give any major spoilers but… the juxtapositions of masculine and feminine, ignorance and pride, tradition and colonialism, and good and evil is just remarkable!

The way Achebe writes is so effortless, not a sight of purple prose. His simple style is very accessible, yet very effective.

Again, I don’t want to give any spoilers away, but it’s probably one of my favourite depictions of colonialism in literature. 

And the ending is just so haunting, really emphasises the disregard of humanity from a certain Empire…

I’ve also read and adored Purple Hibiscus by Adichie, any other African book suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",1
"Visual Subtext in Alison Bechdel's Fun Home *Fun Home* is one of the more voluble graphic novels I've ever read. Its gutters are packed with commentary and subtext and the flow from one panel to the next is not, as in other graphic media, left entirely to the reader's imagination (via blank gutters), but rather carefully constructed. But there are also small gestures and details in the book that are not explicated, which exist for people who are either familiar with the references outright or rather, like myself, curious enough to go hunting down their significance. This visual subtext creates a depth to the narrative that one might miss if they simply read through the graphic novel, paying no attention to the depth of detail in the panels.

Specifically, I'm referring to the books that Bechdel's father is shown to be reading throughout the book. While it could be that Bechdel remembers the books that her father read in his spare time, or has inherited a library that she has taken representative samples from, my suspicion is that Bechdel deliberately chose which books to depict her father reading in the novel, for figurative and/or associative reasons.

I'm going to elaborate upon three distinct examples of this technique from the first section of the book (""Old Father, Old Artificer"").

In the third (and final) panel of the first page of the book, we find a copy of Anna Karenina lying on the floor next to father and daughter in the midst of playing ""airplane."" Given that this is the first page of the graphic novel, we who are familiar with Tolstoy's book are invited to remember the iconic first sentence of Anna Karenina: ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" Given that the subtitle to Bechdel's own book is ""A Family Tragicomic,"" it should not be difficult for us to figure out which of the two categories Bechdel imagines her own family in.

However, this is not the end of it. Tolstoy's novel also >!ends with its eponymous heroine's suicide by train, and Bechdel's father will also commit suicide—or, at least, this is what Bechdel believes, during the course of Fun Home. The inclusion of the book as visual subtext reveals, to initiated readers, a foreshadowing of the narrative to come. If we were to believe Bechdel is particularly ambitious, we might even point out that in this first panel, Bechdel's father finds himself under a machine, or vehicle, in the form of his daughter playing the role of airplane above him, the same way that Anna Karenina finds a machine, or vehicle, (a train) running over her in her final moments of life. !<

The next book that we see Bechdel's father reading is *The Nude* by Kenneth Clark in the first panel on page 15. The caption of the panel is ""I was Spartan to my father's Athenian."" I have the sense that most readers, including myself, would not be familiar with this book, a volume of art criticism on the history of nude art. And yet, the associations become fairly clear fairly quickly as soon as one begins to become familiar with the book in question. First, the tradition of heroic nudity begins in Classical Greece, in places like Athens, the aesthete's region of Greece compared to war-like Sparta. Heroic nudity involves, as Kenneth Clark observes in The Nude, the production of an idealized version of human bodies, nudity as opposed to mere nakedness, ""as a means of affirming the belief in ultimate perfection."" This visual subtext gestures to Bechdel's father's character, since, from the outset of the book, he is portrayed as somebody who believes in a kind of perfection, not only of himself, but of his home, and, ultimately, his children as extensions of himself.

Additionally, her father's apparent fascination with the book creates a contrast between him and Bechdel; although her father was fascinated with the ideal expression of human perfection in the form of nudes, her own art style, when it comes to nudity, is practical and straightforward, a far cry from the idealized form we find in art from antiquity. Later in the book, >!when Bechdel finds a photograph of a seventeen-year-old boy in her father's belongings, she will describe the photo as ""ethereal"" and ""painterly."" An expression of ideal beauty through the art of photography. That is, the photo is a ""nude,"" not merely a picture of a naked boy, or pornography.!<

The final book we see Bechdel's father reading is an abridged version of *The Stones of Venice* by John Ruskin. The original book is in three volumes, concerning the architecture of Venice during the 19th century. It seems clear that some of what we are intended to draw from this book is merely that Bechdel's father's obsession with refurbishing his old house extends to books on architecture in the 1850s. But, since the book is in the public domain, I thought I would read some of it to see what the specific content of the book was and why Bechdel might have chosen it and not some other book to display as a form of visual subtext.

And it becomes quite clear why Bechdel chose to include it, because much of *The Stones of Venice* exists as a kind of love letter to a Venice that is already departed, the ""second throne"" of the world (after Tyre and before England), now fallen into ruin. And this is, of course, the relationship that Bechdel has to her own father—>!a figure now lost, whose character it is now only in Bechdel's power to preserve in any capacity!<. There is a quote from section one of the first book of *The Stones of Venice* that I think captures the essence of the thing:

>I would endeavor to trace the lines of this image before it be for ever lost, and to record, as far as I may, the warning which seems to me to be uttered by every one of the fast-gaining waves, that beat, like passing bells, against the STONES OF VENICE.",1
"Livy or Tacitus? First, some groundwork.

We are not evaluating either work based on the author's veracity, but as literature.
So, please put aside any evaluation of these works based on the accuracy of the history told.
Both authors attempt to portray a moralistic narrative, and though you may say this of all works, classical historians are quite a bit more liberal as regards this. So much for this. 
If you want to skip my opinion and simply tell me yours, then you may stop reading at this point.



I feel as if the easy answer is Tacitus, if you were to argue to me he is superior in almost every way to Livy, I would agree. Regardless, Livy is my preference. 
It is difficult to articulate but Livy's work is very charming to me and while both employ frequent use of direct speech, it is Livy's bread and butter. 
 I would even agree that most of the greatest single speeches out of the works of either can be found in Tacitus.

In Agricola, where both Calgacus (sometimes Galgacus) and Agricola speak to their troops  before the decisive battle at Mons Grapius; the speech of Calgacus is excellent (Agricola 30-32, 30 is of particular note) and one of my favourite single dialogues in any ancient work of history.

However, Livy's incredible ability to pump out a seemingly infinite amount of long-winded speeches and eulogies just does it for me. 
Livy 5.51-54 for one example, books 5 and 6 are my favourite written history, and I have read Livy's first three (Loeb) volumes through twice. The volumes concerning the Hannibalic/Second Punic War are also great.

So much on my thoughts, what do you all think of each?",1
"The Song of Achilles would have been a way better book if it was told from Achilles' pov. When I first read Song of Achilles I felt very disappointed because it was so hyped up everywhere. At a certain point I felt like the book was just going on and on without end and I had to even put it down for a few weeks. Don't get me wrong I believe that the author is very skilled and her writing style was beautiful but I felt like all the potential in this book was wasted. The potential of a story from Achilles' pov would have been way better than Patroclus' and here's why.

* Patroclus is a great character in the Iliad, and what little we got from him I enjoyed. Unfortunately, the most iconic aspect of Patroclus' character was his death and not his ACTUAL character, like his personality and motives. I'm not sure if this is just that Patroclus is heavily insecure about himself, but he rarely talks ABOUT himself, always about Achilles. Achilles is great but we already know him. Patroclus' pov did nothing but glorify and praise Achilles with little to no attention regarding himself. By seeing in Achilles' pov, we could have understood more why he loved Patroclus so much and be told information we already know.
* The romance felt one-sided on Patroclus' part. Patroclus has done many things showing that he loved Achilles ~~almost too much~~ he went to war with him, he was constantly by his side no matter what, he forgave Achilles for almost everything super quickly, he kissed Achilles first, i can probably say more if I went back into the book and wrote it all out. But Achilles seems like he doesn't really care about Patroclus or his feelings until the moment Patroclus is dead. We need to see passion on Achilles' part to understand his justified anger when Patroclus is killed. 
* Achilles' personality was bland because of Patroclus (unfortunately). Because Patroclus almost refuses to genuinely criticize Achilles (ever) until the end and even then he's not as angry as I expected him to be. Achilles is portrayed as this beautiful, talented, strong, intelligent, and brave force of nature, but his negative traits is pretty much non-existent, He never shows the rage, nor the arrogance and childishness that he has later on in the Trojan War. He's just perfect all the time and that's boring (and ruins the romance even more). 

(Note: This wasn't a planned out rant I just genuinely needed to get this off my mind. Fortunately, I did read a fanfic of song of Achilles that scratched the itch I had ever since I read Song of Achilles, so that's great.)",0
"Bilingual reading Today I decided to read A Christmas Carol in both of the languages I speak, (English native, & Spanish) it was an interesting experience to say the least. To see how the story changed yet stayed the same between both versions, I am rather excited to see how other books are in Spanish compared to English.  
I also wanted to ask, how do other Bilingual readers think of various books in their native and secondary languages.",1
"The Brown Plague: Travels through Late Weimar and Early Nazi Germany by Gay journalist Daniel Guerin Like many in the US, I have been inspired by the MAGA movement to explore the rise of fascism in the 20s and 30s. This book The Brown Plague, created from first hand reporting by French Journalist Daniel Guerin is one of the most accessible sources I have found. 

The introduction is almost as interesting as the book, describing the author's free thinking life as a leftist who refused to affirm either communist totalitarian actions or anarchist chaotic tendencies and his journey of self discovery as a gay man. It also gives a short history of Hitler's rise to power and mentions other sources from the same period including the Brown Book of the Reichstag fire and Hitler Terror , and School for Barbarians by Erika Mann.

The book itself consists of a memoir of two consecutive tours of Germany. One in 1932 just before the Nazis took power and one in 1933 after, as the Nazis begin their persecution of gays, leftists and Jews. Ever the leftist, Guerin punctuates his story with calls for solidarity and revolution. After the war started Guerin spent time in Norway and later with the French resistance. In 1933, Guerin obviously has no insight into how far the Nazis would go. Like the film Cabaret, this book is a picture of the beginning of the Holocaust.",1
"Matilda spark My obsession for books started when I first saw the movie, Matilda. 

For those who don't know, a child (girl) gains superpowers after reading books because she doesn't get the comfort and security from her family. Books are the only thing she loves and she doesn't like watching TV like her family.

I actually believed that reading books would give me superpowers, telekinesis to be specific. That journey led me to get a medical degree as well as success beyond my expectations. 

What drove you to be a reader?",1
"Hamnet is worth the hype!! Here I am typing this after just finishing the book and...wow. From the very beginning the artful prose drew me in, I really felt like I was living there in Stratford with the characters. I really love the choice in this story to do away with naming the father Shakespeare and just keep the focus on his family, and I loved how Agnes was portrayed - she was very much her own character, and funny enough, in their hometown, *she* was the figure the people knew, not her husband who always lived with the shadow of his father. 

The little bit in the middle with >!a dramatization of how the plague came to be came out of left field for me but was absolutely great to set the scene for what is happening at the country during this time. !<

Also the last few pages, felt like the best buildup I have ever read in recent time. How everything has led to that final moment, and when it finally hits what the play was for, it was such a poignant moment. 

I'm still fresh off reading the book and can't read too deeply yet into certain things, but the way this portrayed loss and grief really makes you feel for the characters. We mourned with Agnes, but we also get to feel that closure she needed at the end. Would love to know your thoughts if you've already read this book!",1
"Stephen King’s writing, I’m trying, but this first paragraph/page. “Louis Creed, **who had lost his father at three and who had never known a grandfather, never expected to find a father as he entered his middle age, but that was exactly what happened . . . although he called this man a friend, as a grown man must do when he finds the man who should have been his father relatively late in life.** He met this man on the evening he and his wife and his two children moved into the big white frame house in Ludlow. **Winston Churchill moved in with them. Church was his daughter Eileen's cat.** ”

Edit: 
“Where’s the complaint?” “What’s the legit critique?” It was implied and I elaborated in a comment what I think of him. Relax guys.

For actual critique bc apparently my implication isn’t obvious, I find Stephen King’s writing to droning and heavily worded. I would love his stories if he took out all the filler descriptions. 

There’s setting the scene, and there’s Stephen King, who can (my basic made up example of what he does often in everything I have read, this isn’t from a specific book, but I remember reading something of his that just felt exactly like this) write for pages about the soul of a blade of grass blowing in the breeze. He has (imo, not speaking for anyone else) a tendency to fill his books with so much unnecessary descriptors that distract from the story. The scenes he lays out in intense detail before getting to what’s happening, makes the situations boring by the time they come around (again, just my opinion).",0
"What book/series could you reread forever and never get bored? I'm on my 7th reread of one of my favorite series right now (I read it the first time in January this year). I don't know if this is the most I've ever reread a book because I only just started keeping track of my reading. I do this a lot though; when I read Carry On  (Simon Snow #1) for the first time I immediately got the rest of the series, but I'm incredibly impatient, so I read the first book 3 more times while I waited for the others to come in the mail. That means I read the same book 4 times back to back without any breaks. I've read it a few more times since then too.",1
"Reacher Said Nothing by Andy Martin during lockdown I read, among many other things, all the Lee Child novels about Jack Reacher. So when I heard of this account of how Lee Child writes. I thought it would be interesting.

Andy Martin is a Cambridge academic and a great Reacher fan. He watched Lee Child write his twentieth book, Make Me, and wrote about what he'd observed, including interviews and discussions with Child. It's described as a 'metabook', a book about writing a book.

I found it fascinating and do recommend it.",1
"Gone Girl: why I despise everyone in this novel Okay… I had recently stumbled across an Instagram post talking about Sigma Women, or in their own words “she is literally me”. And the person had AMY DUNNE on their list… I have (and still to this day no reason why) people actually think Amy Dunne is a relatable character. Nick was a cheating douchebag. We all get this. But did he deserve to have a murder framed upon him, made to look like the actual suspect, and forced to be trapped in a loveless marriage by a psychotic woman who killed many men and falsely accused them of rape? People will say it’s a “revenge fantasy” but what kind of fantasy is that? Where you blatantly accuse the one you hate of murdering them and killing yourself to ensure that he looks guilty permanently?",0
"What book and author did you read that made you go ""I need all of their books.""? Last Christmas i was given IRobot By Isaac Asimov and fell in love with his world building and writing style. Since then i have read all his robot books and 3 Foundation books. I've paced myself and made sure to read books by different authors inbetween so that i don't get through them so fast but holy moly do i love them.

So i was wondering what author/booms had the same effect on others

Edit: i also forgot that I'll buy anything of Svott Meyer's and Karen Traviss",1
"The Hell's Library series by A.J. Hackwith has given me a deeper love for books and stories. I am finishing the third book, ""The God Of Forgotten Words"", and I wish the series could go on forever. It's hard to describe the way she portrays how incredible and alive books are. The characters and story are unique and lovable. These are books about books.  I'm sad about this series ending before I'm even half way done with the last book. 
Has anyone else read this series? What are your thoughts and opinions on the universe, characters, or anything else? I only know one other person who has read this.",1
"Colin Barrett - Young skins I found this book recommendes I don't know where, I looked for it but only found the ebook and wow it was good! Every story is a little gem by itself, all so vivid, characters so alive... I'm looking forward to reading Homesickness too. I looked for an italian version but apparently it hasn't been translated, unfortunately. 
It also made me wonder why Irish writer are so damn good. If you enjoy tales of rural towns, of failure and disillusion, this is one of the best books you can read.",1
"Finished The shadow of the wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafón and genuinely one of the most incredible book I've ever read This is a book about book . I was little bored at first but author's writing drew me in and after 50 pages it was clear where story was headed and knew very quickly that it was going to be my favorite. This book is masterpiece. It's all about love, betrayal , friendships, life. Every character was so true to their nature.

It shows suffering of human at all stages of life. Friend , lover , mother and father, rich , poor , all of them was suffering one way or another.
The similarities between Daniel and Julians life.
The sacrifice made by Miquel and Nuria. And Nuria, that women was such a strong lady her manuscript was highlight for me I was sobbing like a baby. It left a very deep emotional impression in me.

I finished this last night and couldn't sleep after. I felt I was part of the surrounding and story. It was happy ending but I felt bad coz I was saying goodbye to all the amazing characters I got to know thought-out this book .And this book had great quotes my kindle is full of highlights. 

This book is journey of every single character, their misery, happiness, sacrifice no review can justify the content in it and mine certainly not.

***Books are mirror: you only see in them what you already have inside you***",1
"What was Ray Bradbury's inspiration for Fahrenheit 451? Between this, George Orwell's ""1984"", and C.S. Lewis' ""That Hideous Strength"" (all written around the same time) I want to say it was heavily influenced by World War II.  But it feels like it's a theme reoccurring throughout history (higher powers controling what the common folks should or shouldn't know), which is why I think it feels so prophetic.",1
"Psmith in the City Re-reading this one today. It’s second-tier Wodehouse, which of course means it’s 10000x funnier than almost anything else in creation.

However, no matter how many times I have read these books or googled “how to understand cricket” I cannot make heads or tails of various pivotal cricket scenes. I am assuming getting a century means a good game? Or a great game? How is a “wicket” good? 

I recommend this book highly despite the incomprehensible cricket scenes!",1
"Dickens’ A Christmas Carol has what might be the best character description I’ve ever read. I usually read A Christmas Carol at Christmas time, and I’m always blown away at Scrooge’s character description right at the start of the book. It’s just one paragraph but provides such a clear mental image of Scrooge while also letting the reader know just what kind of man the miserly protagonist is. It’s just so well executed and I wanted to share it for those who haven’t gotten around to reading A Christmas Carol.

Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, suffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.",1
"I had to read The Death of Ivan Iliych for one of my classes this semester. I expected it to be a drag but it legitimately hit me hard It's a very short book at about 50 some odd pages, but considering I was juggling it in the same semester as Calc II, Biochem, and JPN III, it seemed like nothing but a time waste (my fault for taking a philosophy class during a dense semester), but I actually ended up loving it so much I read the entire thing in one sitting despite it being broken up in the syllabus over 3 weeks. 

Ivan was far from being any sort of sympathetic character, and even at the end of the book I found myself not feeling bad for him, but the ideas and concepts brought up in the book are what hooked and affected me. The idea that no matter how much money or man power you throw at it, death inevitably comes for us all. The pain of needing to still exist despite knowing your end is soon, the anguish of realizing all you ever wanted or achieved is for nothing, the reality of being alone in death, and swiftly being forgotten afterwards, it's so crushing man like holy hell.

My entire philosophy class was focused on the concept of death and dying, but this book in particular is what I really took to heart from the entire course. I wouldn't say it, in any way shape or form, made me accept my own mortality, but it kinda.. I'm not sure how to put it, but it makes me less.. something(?). Even if he's fictional, seeing Ivan go from healthy living man to dead is almost sort of cathartic.

The best way I can put it is, imagine you're about to skydive and you're absolutely horrified. You're standing at the plane door too scared to jump, but then you remember seeing some cartoon character do it and it eases your mind just enough to get you over the edge and jump. You know the character and situation was fictional, but for some reason you rationalize it as ""well, if they got through it so can I."" 

That's what Ivan Iliych did for me and death. I'm not any less afraid nor accepting of it, but I now have the mentality of ""he managed to get through this, so I can too.""

Anyway gushing and existentialism over. It's a great book. If you find your self mortified at your mortality, try giving this a read.",1
"I just read Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine and loved it! I’m a psychologist >!and I didn’t see the twist coming at the end!!< I really loved this book.

What do you make of what’s happening in the background when Mummy calls every Wednesday? People are talking. “They” watch Shawshank Redemption repeatedly and Mummy wants to watch Sex in the City. Based on the titles alone, we could interpret it as a redemption is possible but Mummy only wants sex. Or, looking at the content of the SR movie, that people in Mummy’s world would enjoy the idea of escaping from prison. Eleanor probably would never have seen either of those movies but they are lodged in her unconscious. The author specifies the movies so I don’t think they’re random. Why those 2 movies?",1
"The Scapegoat by Daphne du Maurier…am I missing something? I’m a big du Maurier fan and just finished The Scapegoat. I was loving it all the way through but the ending seemed a bit…abrupt? incomplete? unsettling? It didn’t feel like the narrative came round to a satisfying conclusion. 

Still thoroughly enjoyed the book regardless (du Maurier is a genius with atmospheric writing), but I’m curious how others felt about the ending?",1
"Bel Canto by Ann Patchett Just finished this and I would recommend it.

It has its slow moments, but it's pretty enjoyable overall.

Having also read *The Dutch House*, I would say that Patchett has a literary voice and tone that suits me.

The one drawback of *Bel Canto* is that the ending is very abrupt. From a traditional storytelling point of view, I would want a great deal more wrapping up. Conversely, if she intended to end it in an operatic style with a great, sudden, dramatic expression, then it should have been more impactful and even more abrupt than it was. As it turned out, she seems to have fallen between two chairs.

Nevertheless, I'd give it a B+.

If reading for you is taking time out of your day to wring some particular knowledge or experience out of a book, maybe give it a miss.

But if, like me, reading is an activity with an already allotted span of time to fill (you always need to have a book to be reading), put this one on your library list.",1
"The Hunger Games triology I never really cared for the hunger games growing up, possibly because my parents never really ""approved"" of my reading habits and looked down upon ppl who spent money on books (understandable, we're not the richest). 

Anyway, in August I gave the movies a chance first, without even thinking about reading the books but once I finished watching them I had this sudden urge to just dive deeper into this fascinating world which scarily resembled ours. I wanted to know more about the characters, the stories, the thoughts running through Katniss' mind, what was left out and what wasn't. Just everything. So I ordered the first book and then just kept on reading the following two.

I always think like this of every book but it has truly helped me in ways I can't explain. It goes without saying that it's a book written to make you stop and think. Many could simply dismiss it as a story of a love triangle with some action going on in the background but God its so much more than that. It's a stark reminder that we pay attention to the wrong things, it mirros our world and as someone I've seen on tumblr put it: ""it was about the greed of the society, manipulation, mind games, fear, bravery, determination and the need to make a difference"". The amount of sinking feelings and rage I felt reading this series were crazy, I can't put it in any other way. In a way, it shows that everybody just wants peace. People just want to heal (which is why Katniss chooses Peeta). 
I like how this book doesn't give you the perfect heroin, the perfect victim, the perfect girl. I love how annoying Katniss is, how she overthinks, how she calculates, how she's described. I love that the romance wasn't typical. She protected the supposed lover instead of it being the other way around as normally seen. She was rough, insensitive at times, insecure and Peeta was soft, the dandelion, sensitive and caring. I also like how feelings and opinions were always changing as it feels more realistic. How endings and resolved situations were never really resolved as opposed to how often in books, characters just...decide one thing, how they feel about something or someone once and it's perfect and the author doesn't even make them seem human. 
I'm someone who's incredibly anxious and I've been going through a really hard time in life and seeing Katniss battling a lot of stress, anxiety and self doubt really helped. Sometimes you need to know you're not alone and the not only one who experiences certain things, even if it's a character from a book giving you that comfort. 

I wish I could say more but my feelings are all over the place. I just...really enjoyed it.",1
"I really wanted to like the Silent Patient, but… I was so looking forward to this book, and I loved how the author played out the ending and brought all the puzzle pieces together, BUT the journaling piece was so ridiculous to me. 

I am someone who journals and someone who has anxiety and the absolute last thing on my mind would be writing “oh my god, he’s in the house” or “I’ve been injected for morphine” as opposed to looking for a single solution in that situation. It really took me out of the novel which was such a bummer, because it was otherwise fantastic.",1
"I finally read Verity.. and I'm wondering why. So many people have mentioned this book to me that I decided to pick it up.  And I read it in one sitting, and then I got to the end, and mostly I'm irritated because that's $11 and 2-3 hours I'll never get back. And it's not even the insane and extreme acts described in the book - it's that the characters act so completely unnatural, and the setup for the plot is so bizarre and implausible.  And idk, anytime an author goes to such lengths to demonstrate that this character is pure good, or this one is pure evil, I either think they're lying to me or they think I'm stupid. 

Idk, am I a snob or was this a disappointing read for anyone else?",0
"If asked what is better and more fun to read: Dan brown's Robert Langdon series o rGame of thrones.... What would ya all answer....
Like for me it would definitely be game of thrones but one of my friends like Dan brown better... True Dan brown beautifully depicts conflicts between faith and science... And he also shows the importance of  the subject histroy......But Game of thrones is just a realistic awesome fantasy fiction series...show  casing power, betrayal, society issues and all this is set in a medieval background.
... Which is just so entertaining......
Even the seasons based on it are fun even though they deviate a bit from the story...Just saying though Game of thrones is better according to me......",1
"When you were everything by Ashley Woodfolk Just finished this book last night and I adored it. It’s about the ending of a friendship and how the main character (Cleo) struggles without her best friend by her side. 

As someone struggling with her own friendship problems, I adored this book and finished it less than a week I couldn’t put it down. It does a great job at portraying that heartbreak when your platonic soulmate drifts away. Highly recommend",1
"Have you ever felt like you’ve direly misread the tone of a novel? I just saw Greta Gerwig on The Tonight Show saying she found White Noise to be hilarious, and a while ago remember Will Ferrell was going to be cast as Ignatius Reilly in a (long-since dropped) adaptation of A Confederacy of Dunces.

While the comedic aspects of both of those novels (which I consider two of my favorites) were not lost on me, I never considered either to be straight-up comedies, which (based on how Gerwig spoke about the book and Ferrell’s casting) seem to be what they are/were.

I read both novels as tragedies: of systems failing people and people failing systems, from different perspectives, with questionable characters operating things all the way through.

To my reading it seemed serious but a bit silly, in a Sinclair Lewis sort of way, i.e. Very Serious but also a little funny (?)… and overall, far more stark than what the consensus seems to be.

Has anyone else had the experience suggested in the title?",1
"Lucy Foley’s books I first read The Guest List and enjoyed it. I did think the characters weren’t super distinct, but I enjoyed the format and overall was entertained.

Then I read The Hunting Party, which she had released prior to the guest list. This froot looked awfully familiar. Aside from the first person narrative style being the same (which doesn’t have to be a bad thing - nothing bad with being known for a specific writing style), the characters were EXTREMELY similar to The Guest List’s. Got a little bit annoyed because I felt like I was reading the same book again in a slightly different setting.

This week, I decided to give her latest book a chance because I did enjoy reading The Hunting Party.
I just finished it and I don’t know if I’m impressed, amazed or annoyed that she basically wrote the same book AGAIN and got away with it.

I do enjoy the format of the story being told in a first person narrative with every chapter being a different person. But aside from that, there is no originality in these books and the way they’re set up. The characters are all unlikeable, indistinctive, bland, arrogant and hard to root for, and the twists at the end are all too similar for me as well.

What did you all think?",0
"Is it bad that Catcher in the Rye is my favorite book? Ok, I understand why Holden gets a bad rep. He is seen as whiny and annoying. But he’s a 17 year old whose brother (who he was close with) died. 

I also relate to Holden on some level. Feeling like most people are stupid, or fake. This might make me a narcissist, or be a “red flag” to some people. 

To me, Catcher in the Rye feels like an authentic coming of age story.",1
"Speak Today, I began reading the book Speak by Laurie Haise Anderson, and I'm absolutely loving it. It's a little under 200 pages, a short enough read. I have 40 pages left. It's so immersive and incredibly relatable to me. The author completely nails the expression and inner thoughts of the protagonist, who I feel for as a fellow victim of sexual assault with trouble speaking and conflicted inner turmoil when it comes to feelings. It is a book that seems to aim for a young adult demographic, but I am still able to immerse and connect with the story. It progresses well and hints at the traumatic event that shaped the main character without flat out giving it away.  So far, it's an extremely well written book and I completely recommend it to anyone looking for a good, deep story.",1
"in search of the miraculous, anyone? (p.d. ouspensky) this is the book by p.d. ouspensky, author of tertium organum, explaining g.i. gurdjieff's philosophy, the fourth way.

*this is a long post, so I apologize in advance, but here's a TL;DR*

**tl;dr** *i had high hopes for this book, but it was extremely hard to read because of the writing style and repetitiveness of the dialogue.* **has anyone else read this and what did you get from it?**

I really wanted to get into this, because I loved the film The Holy Mountain, as well as Rene Daumal's books - Mount Analogue and A Night of Serious Drinking, which all had characters that were based off gurdjieff.  although I'm agnostic, I'm super interested in esotericism and mysticism, and comparative religion in general.

however, this particular book is, in my opinion, horribly written. literally the entire book is a monologue by ""G."" (gurdjieff), explaining his system. it just goes on and on 

first of all, he makes some really bizarre claims that directly contradict science, and he spends a lot of time talking about how humanity is ""food for the moon"" and that the earth will eventually become a sun, and the moon will become an earth, and gain its own moon. he also contradicts evolution in all sorts of strange ways.

I really like the philosophical and metaphysical aspects of esotericism, but when they make these bizarre pseudoscientific statements like that man can become immortal, it's extremely hard to take seriously.

I do like a few things about the book, but the interesting ideas are few and far between. 

there's no plot to it, it's just one long lecture, or a collection of lectures.. the students of G. seem to take everything he says as gospel, and no one challenges him on some of the more out there claims he makes. much of it is just dull and bland. I think that's partly the fault of the author, the information is presented in such a boring way.

furthermore, it's just all over the place (kind of like this post, I guess)  G. will talk about a certain idea, sometimes getting to an interesting conclusion (like that the last supper was a magical ceremony), but then the next chapter he changes to a completely different topic, and never talks about that subject again.

I get the feeling that G. is making up a lot of it as he goes, because he contradicts himself quite often. I didn't want to believe gurdjieff was a charlatan, but I can't shake the feeling now",0
"The kingdom of back by Marie Lu I don’t know how to start. This book is amazing. The writing and the descriptions in this book are so immersive! With a small group of well developed characters. The emotion and the learning this book gives you by the end of it! It’s emotional, personal and dreamy. For every empathic/emotional and history/classical music lovers this book is for you! The message given at the end of the book is amazingly accurate and deep.",1
"Could not get through the Poppy War (repost for rule compliance)  
I started reading the Poppy War because is was highly recommended by a lot of people, but it was nothing like what suggested.

>!The pure focus on drug use and often inaccurate dosage description for poppy seeds.!<

Honestly it was a very hard time separating the majority of characters, the instructors melded together and the only character that stood out was an explosive obsessed child. The majority of the story passed by very slowly and it was often surprising how little progress was made, and how long it took to get less than a quarter of the way through the book.Personally it is hard to recommend it to others to read. Anyone else give up before even reaching the halfway mark?",0
Metamorphosis - Thoughts It was a very quick read and my first book by Franz Kafka. But a very interesting and unique story. It’s bizarre but I can see the allegorical and philosophical questions that he poses. A very creative way to question the certain psychological problems that arise in relationships and how people deal with them. I’m sure there are many ways to interpret this story but I’d say it’s about how hard it can be to try and alter certain aspects of very close relationships. Especially in regards to families. Don’t think the book is for everyone but I enjoyed it. Overall a 7.2/10,1
"About Grace by Anthony Doerr is boring and Icky I picked this book up from my library and was disappointed in a couple ways.  First and most obvious is he spends wayyyy to much time describing things that don’t need in depth descriptions.  This is usually my number one reason for not liking a book. 

Second and far worse, there were multiple times he was extremely descriptive about the way a young girls body felt in the hands or arms of the main character.  Such as describing her pelvis or hips against his neck as he carried her on her shoulders.  

I checked myself and thought, is he describing everyone’s bodies he comes into contact with like this? No, no he was not.  Just ICK.  I returned that one and do not recommend at all. Though I can say I 100% loved his latest book Cloud Cuckoo Land. 

Super unexpected to run into this after having really appreciated his later work.  Anyone else notice this in this book or his others? Maybe I missed it somehow in his other books.",0
"Question about The Handmaid’s Tale and The Testaments I just finished reading the Handmaid’s Tale and The Testaments by Margaret Atwood back-to-back for the first time. I greatly enjoyed both, but I’m confused.

Spoilers for both books ahead 

(Full disclosure: I’m only going off what I read in the books. I’ve seen a couple episodes of the show and am not entirely sure what happens). 

Is the narrator of the Handmaid’s Tale (Offred in the the book, but maybe named June) Agnes and Nicole’s mother? It seems likely that she could be Agnes’s mother since there’s evidence Agnes tried escaping to Canada with her mother but failed. But if that’s true, when did Offred/June give birth to Nicole? 

I didn’t think she got pregnant in the Handmaid’s Tale, and was rather helped by Mayday to escape. But the Testaments suggests baby Nicole was the daughter of a prominent commander in Gilead (hence all the hype to get her back) so it would seems unlikely to me that Offred/June would be her mother (since she was on the run and it was never confirmed she got pregnant by her commander). Unless she was recaptured after the events in the Handmaid’s Tale and escaped again?

What do y’all think? Am I missing something, or is it meant to be ambiguous?",1
"Fairy Tale by Stephen King. I’m going to start this by saying I’m *very* fond of Stephen King. I haven’t read all of his books or seen all the movies but I watch and read a lot. I’ve loved everything of his I’ve seen and read so far. Fairy Tale is an exception to the rule. 

The first half or so of the book is as good as expected for King fans. It’s his usual creepy crawly setup where you’re not entirely sure who the monster is. I love that since I’m usually too dense to guess what it is or what’s going on. It’s part of the joy. 

Then we get to the 2nd part of the book where the fairy tale references start and King has his monster coming. Without the narrator of the audiobook I feel like this half kind of would have fallen on its face. I love and knew every reference. I knew everything going on in the stories and as a result could quickly figure out what was happening for once. One reference in particular basically gave me the ending at one point which honestly almost made me turn the audiobook off. Without what was frankly an amazing narrator it would have fallen flat for me.",0
"I just finished the last book in James S. A. Corey's The Expanse I can't remember having felt this strongly about a book series since  reading Harry Potter at a young age.

"I think I'm done with Tom Robbins. **TL;DR** \- He is another ""man writes about woman"" author. Most of his novels are written from a ""female perspective"" and it reads more like some dude's weird fantasy of women. As a woman I cannot relate to the things he writes or the way he describes women (including women he doesn't find attractive, i.e. fat women). It is impossible for me to go on reading his works without feeling a tinge of disgust. His stories are fun and whimsical and I wish he would just stick to male protagonists and not overly sexualize women the way he does in every. single. novel. 

&#x200B;

Tom Robbins holds a very special place in my heart for being the author that got me into reading. I was one of those kids who hated reading. Around 19 or 20, I was given *Another Roadside Attraction* and my world changed. I realized I didn't hate reading, I just wasn't picking the right books (honestly you can thank the public education system choosing the absolute worst books for youth to read). I've been a reader ever since.

After *Another Roadside Attraction*, I went on to read many of his books (*Fierce Invalids, Still Life with Woodpecker, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues*... there might be others.) Most of these I read in my early to mid-20's. 

I kinda lost interest in Tom Robbins mostly because I enjoy non-fiction (plus other authors like Vonnegut stole my attention). Plus I looked back and thought some of his writing was a little cringey. Couldn't put my finger on it but something about it was almost.... uncomfortable? for me to read (I should clarify at this point that I am a woman). Uncomfortable isn't the best word but it's what I'm going to use. 

Anyway.

I've been in a bit of a reading rut. I was at the library looking for a book to read when *Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas* caught my eye. Since I needed something to read, and since it had been so long since I had read a Robbins book, I decided fuck it, let's just go for it. 

Almost immediately I found myself scrunching up my face at the things he would write. You know, things like the fact that the main character wears ""panties"" with ""two little pink bows"" on them (infantilizing much?). Here are two quotes from the book:

>*The smile that slices across the bony plain of his stubble jaws is as fierce as a paper cut, and his eyes are as reddened as bedsores, as probing as coat hangers. You feel their gaze on your uterus.*

..

>*Everybody in town has a front-row seat at the first public viewing of your twat: each and every hair countable, labial road map unfolded for consultation, clitoris a gleaming morsel awaiting cocktail fork or chopsticks.*

That last quote is where I put the book down. Sorry, but I cannot endure anymore of this cringe-worthy writing. 

And don't get me started on how relentless he is in making the reader know just how fat the main character's friend (Q-Jo) is. We get it, she's fat!! It is wildly unnecessary to emphasize this fact about Q-jo every. single. time. she's brought up. It's like all other aspects/qualities of this character are totally brushed aside because she's fat. He somehow he finds a way to bring up Q-jo's body even at times when it literally has nothing to do with the story line. The way he brings up her fatness is always grotesque and insulting (I tried picking a quote to share here but there were literally so many instances I couldn't pick one.) Like jeez, sorry some women don't meet your fantasy ideal, Tom! \*rolls eyes\*

I guess with age I can no longer glance over these things. As a woman I am *so* over it. Which is a shame because truly, I do not think he is a bad writer or story teller. 

I seriously need a new book to read.

PS - This post is way longer than I ever intended it to be.

Edit: mistyped a word in the first quote, corrected the word.",0
"Has anybody read this years Pulitzer Prize Books? I’ve read “Monkey Boy” and “The Netanyahus” and am starting “Palmares”

"Legends and Lattes: The appeal of cozy fantasy! I am currently on chapter 12 of *Legends and Lattes* by Travis Baldree and I am mesmerized. It is such a nice, lovely, cozy read.

I have been in a reading slump lately and needed a palate cleanser and this book was recommended to me by a friend and it is exactly what I needed to get back into the reading spirit.

The book has incredibly low stakes and yet there are multiple conflicts that keep me wanting to read just one more chapter every night. The characters are relatable but also classic fantasy character tropes.

If you are looking for a book that feels like the literary equivalent to a lofi music playlist. I highly recommend this novel!

Edit: and to top it off the author is currently working on a prequel!",1
"I'm getting a little tired by the ""plot twists"" in Maggie Steifvater's, The Dreamers Trilogy THIS POST WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR ALL THREE BOOKS. 

With that out of the way,  I was just venturing into the book community to see if anyone else shares my frustrations with the Dreamer Trilogy by Maggie Steifvater. Ronan was never my favourite character but I still enjoy Maggie's series so I tried it out. I know Ronan is her favourite character and it can be pretty obvious sometimes. Most notably, I feel like every plot twist in this series is that either Ronan dreamt it, or another Dreamer dreamt it thanks to Ronan. I'm getting really tired that every single surprise in this book reveals some important plot piece to be a dream. New character? A dream. Existing character? A dream. Important plot devices? Dreams, dreams, dreams. 

I get it, it might be kind of silly to complain that everything is made of dreams in a series about someone that can bring dreams into real life, but it feels like soon enougheverything in this world is gonna end up a dream. I bet the last plot twist will be that Ronan literally dreamt the world into existence. 

My last complaint which is really just me being picky, where the heck are Blue and Gansey while the world is apparently going to crap and their friend is at risk of dying? Seems kind of like the whole leyline being gone plot would concern the people who are connected to it like Blue's prophetic family. 

Anyway, am I the only one annoyed by the Dreamers Trilogy plot?",0
"Why isnt Bryce Courtenay more widely celebrated as a great novelist? I have now read five books by Courtenay, the Australian Trilogy and The Power of One double. Every book I read of his is highly enjoyable and he is a fantastic storyteller.

I hardly ever see any of his books mentioned on here. It surprises me I suppose. I cant wait to read all of his other novels.",1
"Just finished A Movie Making Nerd (James Role's autobiography) and here are my thoughts Anyone who has browsed YouTube back before the 2010s has probably heard of the Angry Video Game Nerd, a video game reviewer who took you “back to the past” playing bad games, having violent outbursts, and constantly alluding to fecal matter. His origins lie before these kinds of reviews became a dime a dozen on YouTube, going back as far as 2004 on MySpace. Now, creator James Rolfe has become an internet icon, releasing reviews even in 2023 with each review reaching millions of views as well as releasing more original content on Cinemassacre. He’s even released a feature film based on The Nerd, to mixed reviews. Two weeks ago, he released an autobiography on Amazon detailing his work with short films and his life leading into the creation of the Angry Video Game Nerd. I usually listen to audiobooks for reading, but I found that I was so fascinated by the physical version, I couldn’t put it down. I know the book isn’t for everyone, especially considering he wrote it all himself, but if you want to hear a ton of interesting short stories and snippets from a coming-of-age internet star, this is a great read.


The book is released for Kindle, an audio format, and paperback. There are a ton of reports of spelling errors on the ebook version, but the physical version doesn’t have this problem. As of now, James and his team are working to get the Kindle version fixed through updates. I highly recommend the paperback version as it doesn’t have this problem.


The book is a very easy read. It is printed in a large font, there are tons of pictures, and James does his best to describe terminology that may be unfamiliar to younger or inexperienced viewers. Even if it's terminology I easily understand, I find that it doesn’t slow down the narrative in any way. Here’s an example:


>“Sean Keegan became our producer. He was there to take our creative dreams and turn them into reality. That was his job. To figure out how to make it happen. None of us had any idea how much something like this would cost, but he was there to figure it out.”


James had written the whole book himself, and though he has written and directed many videos and films, he’s not exactly an experienced novel writer. It’s clear that he has written things here-and-there most of the time when writing this book, as there is no overarching prose or writing style, it’s kind of all over the place until near the end of the book when he talks about his feature film, the main “climax”. If that turns you off then it may not be for you, but I feel that it gives it a personal touch. It’s not written by a famous writer, but from a short-form content creator with his own various stories to tell. If you don’t mind the lack of a ghostwriter, it’s still very interesting. As I’ve said, it’s hard for me to put down.


If you’re familiar with Cinemassacre and AVGN, you’re probably familiar with a few of the controversies surrounding them, such as the ones surrounding Mike Metei or Bootsy. These people are mentioned, but these controversies discussed elsewhere online are not mentioned in this book. In fact, The Nerd does not come into the picture until halfway into the book, and is only the sole subject of discussion for half of a chapter with a full chapter specifically for how the movie was made. While this is a big disappointment, James does reveal a lot of stuff from his childhood and teenage years which are extremely personal. I will make a spoiler tag for those who are interested, though I highly recommend reading it yourself. 


>!James discusses his ADD and how he grew up in Special Ed until high school. He discusses how he was in a car crash with his grandmother which left him with trauma and left her incapacitated for the rest of her life. He was nearly expelled in college when he created a home movie of his roommates swearing, smoking weed, and trashing his apartment.!<


To my knowledge, these were not previously mentioned whatsoever on any Cinemassacre content. It’s clear that James has a history before The Nerd when he used mainly vhs recorders and film equipment, so getting to hear his full childhood backstory was very welcome. I do however find the lack of AVGN mentions to be somewhat of a let down, since that was also a huge part of his history as well. I only wish the book was longer so we can hear more behind-the-scenes for The Nerd outside of the movie.


A whole chapter based solely on the AVGN film was also unexpected. I was a bit apprehensive to see an internet film with mixed opinions somehow make a whole chapter of the book, but reading through it all, I can very well see why. Ever since James was a child, he wanted to make a feature film. It ultimately becomes the culmination of James' hard work to make his lifelong dream a reality. It’s met with tons of hardships from the start, filled with questions without a ton of answers, and a very stressful deadline to meet. Most of the movie uses special effects, using models, costumes, and props to create alien spaceships, tanks, and giant robots. I was extremely fascinated by the productions behind the scenes. As mixed as this movie’s reviews are, some people don't fully realize how daunting of a task it was to make an action-based blockbuster comedy into an indie b-movie with very little budget. Even if James went a little overboard, even going as far as to film in LA, that’s just the kind of guy he is, and it’s very inspiring to see it all work out and see his dream become a reality.


This is very much a must-read if you’re an Angry Video Game Nerd fan. Even if The Nerd is not mentioned as much as I’d have hoped, it’s still amazing seeing all of the stuff he’s been through as a child and how he had to push through it all to make movies. If you ever enjoyed [“The Dragon in my Dreams”](https://youtu.be/4Kc3JqVIIJA) video, the book very much takes on that exact vibe. I actually recommend seeing that video if you’re curious of how the book is going to feel. In particular, I recommend this book if you’re a film buff and are interested in seeing a content creator live out his dreams of making movies and videos for a living. I feel that this is what this book is for.",1
"is Nassim Nicholas Taleb wrong about uncertainty in his books trilogy ""Incerto""? Months ago I ended reading Incerto trilogy and was so shocked by the way it has changed my awareness of so many topics. 
So I started looking for something that could falsificate/counter his theories, but almost everything I read were criticism about his attitude and tone, about his economists jokes and in general about his personality and the way he writes. 

Never heard anything against his philosophy and here I am asking reddit. 

Personally, as a quantitative finance student it has changed my point of view about options (nor loving neither hating them) and in general about what we don't know, so what you think?",1
"“The Books of Jacob” was a 1,000 page slog but I see why it won the Nobel Prize and I’m glad I read it. The book tells the story of Jacob Frank, a self proclaimed Jewish messiah from Eastern Europe. The story is told from the perspective of his contemporaries and disciples and so the narrative is patchy and somewhat non-linear. Certain perspectives are really enjoyable while others drag. In the style of a Jewish text the page numbers count down instead of up which keeps you motivated as you grind through it. 

Reading this book felt like a second job at times but it was also a really cool period piece from a time and place we don’t often hear about in the English speaking world (1700’s Poland, Turkey, and Austria). The story of fanatical devotion to a charismatic leader also drew interesting parallels to modern life. All in all a cool book with a hint of magical realism that told the fictionalized version of a real story that I otherwise would never have learned about. Glad I read it, glad it’s over.",1

"Ronnie Spector (Be My Baby Memoir) A Real Flower in the Attics Life  I finally decided to get around to reading/listening to Ronnie Spector's memoir and **BA-BY!** A true horror story one would think Stephen King made it up. Sadly, for Ronnie her years with her ex weren't just a story, it was her real life.  


Ronnie really did live an incredible life. Singing at the Apollo at age 11, singing at the Peppermint Lounge, getting singed with her sister and cousin Estelle and Nedra, to hanging out and touring with the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. Ronnie chilling with David Bowie, Billy Joel, the Beach Boys, the Ramones, the Misfits who loved the Ronettes. Ronnie having a kickass friendship with Cher and Darlene Love. Ronnie was the ultimate bad girl of Rock N Roll who had her career stopped dead in its tracks because of that Phil Spector.  


Literally from the first time they met, Phil set his eyes on Ronnie and became **OBSESSED** to the tenth degree!  


 I never read her memoir in full which led to me finding out a lot of stuff that I did not know before. 

P Spector was 100% a psychopath, he had issues. He was little twerp of man who was as thin as a twig, and was balding at 22, he got his hooks into Ronnie and did not want to let her go, yet he didn't want for her to be the star that she was and let her sing.  


Some of the things I picked out from the memoir of Phil and Ronnie's marriage:  


**TRIGGER WARNING ABUSE:**  


* After the girls sang for Phil when they first met him, his set his sights on Ronnie when they all went out to eat and immediately singled her out.
* Phil didn't even want to sign Estelle and Nedra he just wanted Ronnie, but Ronnie's mom made it clear that all three were going to be signed together.
* He snatched the phone out Ronnie's hand one time, because his creative process was interrupted by a noise complaint.
* Phil invited Ronnie to his Penthouse to go over a song and when Ronnie saw a bunch of shoes and women's clothes on the floor, he snapped on her and lied and said that those things were his sisters **(it was his wife's**).
* After her mom took her out of the mansion that Phil and Ronnie were living in, after weeks of not being able to locate her, he randomly got in this big accident, and used that to get Ronnie to come back with him.
* Yelled in her face a lot. Cussed her out, called her Bitch a lot.
* R went to Phil's office one time and found his whole office filled and covered with nothing but pictures of **HER**! He had a whole **shrine** of Ronnie.
* R spent her wedding night locked in the bathroom with her mom cause Phil when on a psycho rant/tantrum and accused Ronnie of just marrying him for his money.
* Got in her face and yelled at while they were at the top of the stairs, she got scared and fell down the stairs got a sprained ankle.
* Phil called her a ""little girl"" a lot despite only being 4 years older than her.
* Phil only called Ronnie ""Veronica"", nobody called Ronnie by her full name.
* Phil kept Ronnie in the recording booth with him, away from the other singers/friends of hers and didn't let her sing background vocals with the rest of them. Didn't let her leave the recording booth, she had to sit on a stool. She would hear all of the other artists/her friends laughing and fun together.
* Sent bodyguards to bring her back home if she was gone longer than 20 minutes (**whenever he did actually let her out of their mansion**).
* Didn't get to eat/sleep a lot while in the mansion.
* Phil had intercom systems installed in damn near every room of their mansion.
* Phil took her shoes so that she wouldn't runaway barefoot.
* Phil pulled guns on Ronnie
* Phil threatened to kill Ronnie and put her in a gold coffin.
* Ronnie was threatened by Phil that he was going to have hitman kill her.
* Their mansion barbed wire, electric fences, and big ass guard dogs running around the yards.
* Doors were locked from the inside, Phil and his bodyguards had the keys, and security bars were put on the windows. There was no way for her to get out of that mansion.
* Was physically grabbed/pulled/yanked by Phil when he was angry/jealous.
* Was chased around by Phil in their mansion, ran away from Phil when he came at her violently.
* Was pushed out the door by Phil after a fight. Spent a night at a hotel, was hit in the face by Phil before that.
*  Phil literally locked Ronnie in a **CLOSET**!!!! with a **PADLOCK**!!! Don Kirshner heard her screams/banging on the door and got her out of the closet.
* Ronnie was given a car by Phil for her 25th birthday but had to ride around with a **fake dummy/doll** like Phil and she had to keep it in the seat next to her. He didn't want people thinking that Ronnie was alone.
* Ronnie didn't see a stage or was allowed to sing (**yes even at home in the mansion**) for those years that she was with Phil, it was said that Ronnie couldn't even listen to the radio either.
* Ronnie with her mother's help after a physical fight with Phil, finally escaped the mansion in 1972, and finally divorced him in 1974.
* Eventually won the rights to the music she and the Ronettes made, met her second husband Jonathan Greenfield, remained married to him for 39 years and had two kids together with him.

 The Ronettes deserved so much better! They had years of great music and songs to give to the world, but they couldn't because some dude was too insecure to let a young beautiful, talented, woman be the star that she was. Rest in Peace/Rest in Heaven Ronnie and Estelle. 

I didn't realize how deep Ronnie's story goes. Did anybody else know Ronnie and her group the Ronettes history before her memoir came out?",1
"Trauma, Dissociation, and The Time Traveler's Wife CW: dissociation, violent death

One of my beliefs about literature is that it's complex—maybe more complex than one person can process. That's because, when we read, our minds are temporarily jacked in to another person's stream of consciousness. A prepared, orchestrated consciousness, but nonetheless a set of thoughts that came from another mind, which are now being ""broadcast"" into our minds. But, of course, our minds wander; certain words may trigger different associations for different readers; certain events may trigger different memories. So a text is never just the words on paper, and trying to claim that a text means just one thing is, by definition, a doomed enterprise.

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about literature and, to my mind, the highest study of literature comes in the form of conversations between readers that share the details and interpretations of the different readings of a text so that everybody can gain a deeper knowledge and appreciation of how rich and complex the literature we love actually is.

So, bearing that in mind, here is an interpretation:

>>!""We hit the truck practically in slow motion, or so it seemed to me. In actuality, we were going about forty. The truck was an open pickup truck full of scrap metal. When we hit it, a large sheet of steel flew off the back of the truck, came through our windshield, and decapitated my mother.""!<

[The Time Traveler's Wife](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookpunk/collection/f1bb4c32-93e7-4f25-9b16-0d38441fe64a) by Audrey Niffenegger, pages 111-12

[The Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dissociative-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20355215) defines three different types of dissociative disorders: dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder (or DID), and depersonalization-derealization disorder. All three disorders are considered to be responses to post-traumatic stress, especially resulting from trauma experienced as a child.

The Mayo Clinic defines dissociative amnesia as: ""memory loss that's more severe than normal forgetfulness and that can't be explained by a medical condition,"" an inability to ""recall information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a traumatic time."" Henry>!loses ten minutes and forty-seven seconds of his memory, immediately after witnessing his mother's decapitation and nearly losing his own life. During this time, he is physically transported from the site of the accident to an unknown location (though I suspect the subject will be treated later in the novel, I just haven't gotten to it yet). That is, his time-traveling, or chrono-impairment, acts as a post-traumatic response similar to dissociative amnesia. It is a physical manifestation of a mental disorder.!<

The Mayo Clinic defines depersonalization as: ""an ongoing or episodic sense of detachment or being outside yourself — observing your actions, feelings, thoughts and self from a distance as though watching a movie."" We can see one example of depersonalization when >!Henry encounters his younger self in the Field Museum after his younger self time travels for the first time (which must surely have been traumatic). In the case of the accident that kills his mother, Henry undergoes a kind of ""hyper-depersonalization,"" where he not only ""observ\[es\] \[his\] actions ... and self from a distance,"" but actually observes himself from many different vantage points and distances. !<

But Henry doesn't only depersonalize; he experiences>! his return to the scene of the accident as a kind of post-traumatic flashback. He time travels to the accident ""\[o\]ver and over"" He is ""in cars, behind bushes, on the bridge, in a tree."" He has ""seen it from every angle."" And like many sufferers of post-traumatic stress, his mother's death becomes for him ""the pivotal thing."" !<

>!Of course, the difference between Henry and the ordinary sufferers of depersonalization is that he can actually interact with his younger self in the moment of his trauma. He calls his father with a message to go to the hospital, puts a blanket around his younger self's shoulders.!< This is the fantasy of trauma: that, given the chance, we would go back and change things for our younger self. But the cost of doing so is that Henry>!must experience the moment of his mother's death over and over again. His time-travel becomes a vehicle for the expression of a mental illness that centripetally compels him to the same point in time over and over again. And there are real limits to what he can do to help himself in the past, as the book illustrates time and time again when emphasizing the theme of determinism. He cannot actually do anything to keep his mother from dying. !<

Mental illnesses are often complex and difficult to understand, even (or especially) for the people who suffer from them, but Niffenegger seems to have dramatized two such illnesses in the form of Henry's time-traveling >!repeatedly back to the site of his mother's death.!< She imagines a world where the operations of our mind can be externalized and seen, written into space-time as a form of >!eternal return to our trauma,!< but also a world where we are equipped >!to provide small comforts to our traumatized selves. A phone call here, a blanket there.!< And who knows what small kindness might make a difference?",1
"Hispanic/Latino stereotypes in Dr. Seuss's ""The Cat's Quizzer""? ""The Cat's Quizzer"", published in 1976, is one of Dr. Seuss's most obscure titles. It's also one of the books that infamously went out of print in 2021 because of racial stereotypes.

The most common reason given for ""The Cat's Quizzer"" being removed from print is the illustration accompanying the question ""How old do you have to be to be a Japanese?"" This was mentioned in the Wikipedia article for the book. Appropriately, the book also has the category ""Stereotypes of East Asians"".

However, Wikipedia also categorizes ""The Cat's Quizzer"" as ""Stereotypes of Hispanic and Latino people"", even though the article itself never mentions any such stereotypes.

As someone who hasn't read the book in years, I don't remember it having any problematic portrayals of Hispanics or Latinos. If you have read the book recently, are there any such stereotypes? If so, what are they?",0
"What recurring story elements (Easter eggs) do you notice from your favorite authors? An obvious example would be Stephen King using Maine as the setting for most of his novels. I have been reading a good bit of Cormac McCarthy and noticed that the man loves the word “galvanized”. Honestly a great word but it does appear a lot in his prose. I also noticed reading McCarthy, recurring “black haired women” as love interests, and if stated, his protagonists are always left handed.

"In the mountains of Transylvania: Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"". Before I even was aware of Stoker's famed novel, my only conception of Dracula was the 30s film featuring Bela Lugosi and a myriad of pop culture references. My own discovery of the novel would come much later and eventually would come to read the book itself when I had checked it out at one time (and now I finally have my own copy which I've just finished!).

Stoker's story, with the setting being in Romania in the beginning and end to England in the middle section, about several individuals pitted against the vampire Count Dracula is a spectacular piece of horror fiction. The way it is written is something that is quite interesting and is something I've seen before.

The story is told via by the main protagonists through diary entries, mail correspondence and also including various clippings as well. And in the writing Stoker mixes in some bizarre and conventionally polite behaviors as well as religious and vague sexual themes.

The novel, since its publication in 1897, has left a huge mark in both literature and pop culture. The book has been adapted into film multiple times and there are countless references in television as well. Plus there are also many writers who created their own spin on the novel and of the vampire lore as well, both good and bad. Truly influential!",1
"I do not think the Great Gatsby is a critique of American society First of all, I say this with the utmost respect, I am here to discuss not to fight or argue.

The Great Gatsby is my favorite novel of all time, in my opinion it is the greatest piece of western literature ever created.

Whenever I have a discussion with someone or read something about it the book is described as being a sort of **""Critique of American society, class values, social taboos, etc...""**

I think this is inaccurate, I believe that this is in the book but only because if a good author accurately describes a reality which is contradictory or flawed that will be portrayed naturally in the work.

**In reality, I believe the main idea of the book is the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.** It is about pursuing that fantastical, vague, child like fantasy we all posses in our heads. The place where we go when we daydream about what we wish we could be. Gatsby never cared about money, about Daisy, about any of it. He was chasing an image that he had built in his head of his ultimate self, and in that image were things like wealth and people like Daisy. Of course, reality can never meet that dream. When you get the things you thought would paint that picture, they are disappointing. This is perfectly represented in the following quote:

> Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. 

As soon as Gatsby achieved his goal, it no longer seemed significant. 

The Great Gatsby is a novel representing Fitzgerald struggled with in his own life, reality can never be the image you paint or novel you write in your own head. Once you grasp the green light, it's not so special anymore.",1
"The Sympathizer by Viet Nguyen Wow what a beautiful brutal book. This book is one of my contenders to be remembered over time. The author is intelligent and insightful. The language is beautiful with creative metaphors that are helpful not distracting. The book is a mix of psychological reflection and action. It reminds me of Crime and Punishment but a lot more happens. It starts with the Fall of Saigon and moves to the US. There is combat and espionage and friendship and sex and cruelty and sympathy. I would recommend it to any reader who is willing to subject themselves to the subject matter. As a spy novel this is much more brutal than Clancy or LeCarre. This book is interesting and technically accurate as far as I can tell but it is emotionally intense and does not shrink from gritty realism regardless of the subject matter. I won't spoil it by giving further details, but yes, if you are up for the experience, read this book.",1
"Garth Marenghi’s TerrorTomb Welcome friend, just about finished the audiobook and loving it. Genuinely laugh out loud good which, even with books I enjoy, is rare. It probably helps that Matthew Holness (Garth) is narrating.

The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger, page xxiv

Always interesting to unpack the fantasy of a romance. Despite its reputation as a genre full of cliché and sentimentality, there may be no better barometer for the state of a society than its romance novels. In the case of *The Time Traveler's Wife,* both a romance and science fiction in the tradition of H.G. Wells. A romance novel reveals the state of the relationships between individuals who choose to be voluntarily associated in a society: the attractions and the tensions that define them.

The basic conceit of *The Time Traveler's Wife,* as I understand it, is that Henry, the man, is transported randomly and without warning through time while time passes normally for his wife Clare. But although this may sound like an outlandish story, when you look at the language employed by its author, it's actually quite a familiar one.

Clare represents a fantasy of a stoic woman who ""wait\[s\] for Henry."" At home, while he time-travels. But how much does the fact that he time-travels actually matter? At the very beginning of the novel, Clare compares Henry to men who ""went to sea,"" while the women ""waited for them."" Of course, the men who went to sea went to sea as fishermen, working long hours in dangerous conditions in order to feed their families. By creating this comparison, Niffenegger reveals that *Henry's time-travel is a form of labor.*

And if we read a bit further, we'll find that the comparison holds true. Henry ""vanishes unwillingly."" Most people working in the world today don't perform their jobs voluntarily—they do so in order to survive. Their real lives are always elsewhere: at home. He vanishes ""without warning,"" the way that many people are called in to their jobs at odd hours, or asked to stay longer than usual, at the drop of a dime, an opportunity that many feel compelled not to refuse. Here, we have an old fantasy: the woman stays at home, the man goes ""where \[she\] cannot follow.""

For her part, Clare spends her time waiting for Henry, her personality obliterated in the face of the love that she feels for Henry. This signals to the reader the strength of her love precisely because she is driven into her own kind of time-travel (""each moment ... feels like a year, an eternity,"" ""each moment is as slow and transparent as glass"") by the love that she feels for Henry: a love uncomplicated by his presence in her life.

On the opposite end of the relationship, we find that the time traveler, Henry, lives a chaotic life, in which he is transported at random to various points in time, naked. Leaving aside the erotic implications of a (undescribed, and therefore whoever you want him to be) naked man who can appear spontaneously literally anywhere, we find him fit into the fantasy because, despite living this life filled with excitement (where, we are told, he freely steals and is often arrested), he longs only for ""homey"" pleasures. And ""Clare, always Clare.""

In this narrative, Henry's true life begins and ends at home, where Clare waits. When he goes where she cannot follow, he wishes only to return. And Clare, for her part, does little other than ""keep herself busy"" waiting for Henry's return. This is a fantasy that seems almost anachronistic, belonging more to an era like the 1950s than 2003. But, then, there are plenty of people even today who idolize the 1950s as an idyllic time when ""men were men"" and ""women were women."" If you're looking for fantasy, it doesn't get more concrete than Henry missing ""the symmetry of grocery bags... waiting to be unpacked."" Henry is a man who yearns even for the promise of domestic chores.

And this is, ultimately, a romance that must thrive through the alienation of capitalism. Henry is a man called away from home against his will, to work at random hours, while his wife waits for him at home. Yet, despite this, and the alienation he feels (an alienation from *space and time itself*), he thinks of nothing except returning home to his wife, the smell of his wife's hair, the softness beneath his wife's breast, and grocery bags waiting to be unpacked. This all within the first four pages of the book.

A fascinating reading of society's barometer in the year 2003.",1
"Missing quotation marks, what's up with that? Just finished (for the second time) The Snow Child by Eowyn Ivey. I love this book, but I'm trying to understand something and hope that someone here can help. 

Certain passages have quotation marks when the characters are speaking while others do not. It seems to be random, not applied to any one character or characters, and (I think) is consistent within a given chapter. 

Does this mean something that I'm just not getting? Is this a known thing that I just don't know?",1

I just forget how much I love their chemistry, communication, stubbornness, hard work, and their overall relationship each time I reread the books. I wondered who is like them, or comparable, other than Morticia and Gomez from the two Addams Family movies.

So, what fictional characters in books that you've read have displayed your version of #couplegoals?",1
"The Only Good Indians - discussion I finished reading ""The Only Good Indians"" by Stephen Graham Jones a week ago or so and I'm curious as to what other people thought about it? I think overall I enjoyed the book and the story and the way it was told, I had to get used to the sudden shifts in character perspective in the middle of the action but once I adjusted it wasn't a big deal. At first I was a little on the fence about the way the big ""show down"" took place at the end of the book but I've since come around after sitting on it for a few days. The end of the book dragged a little bit for me but it wasn't too much of a slog. 

Here are some of my thoughts on the themes and my take aways from the book. I made a YouTube video going into more details if you're interested but I'll put a quick bullet point list just to get some ideas out there!  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAVQxlXPE60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAVQxlXPE60)

&#x200B;

* I think the main themes of the story were cultural identity and generational trauma and guilt. The elk headed woman is their guilt in physical form born from their guilt of breaking ties with their native american heritage and the culture of the reservation
* Cultural identity is explored in many interesting and different ways. Lewis loves his wife Peta but also has some thoughts in the back of head about being the one who ""ran off to marry a white girl."" it seems a few of the characters have to try and exist in two worlds, the native american world and the white western world but not fully belonging to either. I also got this theme from opening with Ricky in the drive bar with the patrons he describes as ""cowboys and rednecks"" (who ultimately beat him to death) and at the end of the book with Gabe's daughter, Denorah, who is being raised off of the reservation by her mother and step father
* The Thanksgiving Classic is a huge taboo of not just breaking modern hunting laws but breaking the traditional laws of the reservation by the four friends. They knowingly went into forbidden grounds of the reservation during their hunt and essentially slaughtered an entire herd of elk. They were unable to keep any of the meat because they were caught by the game warden and wasted all of those elk that they killed; the opposite of native americans using every part of the animal out of respect
* I think Denorah finding her place in the world through basketball was a contrast to the four main friends who were never quite able to find a place for themselves on the reservation or off. Denorah ultimately uses basketball as a bridge between the two worlds she walks in and through that she is able to break the generational trauma and guilt

Those are just a few of my thoughts on the story and I'm sure other people have different interpretations or other ideas I hadn't thought of. What did you think of ""The Only Good Indians""?",1
"Barbara Pym is not funny After multiple suggestions in Jane Austen groups to read Barbara Pym because she was similar to Jane Austen, I have given the Pym a try.

I really dislike her. I started Crampton Hodnet, which had such a promising title! But so far it is cold, bitter, and mean, with not the slightest suggestion of frisks and jollifications. The beginning scenes are clearly designed to be funny, with several college students going to an uncomfortable tea party. One of them steps on a potted cactus. But the entire scene is heavy and written so dimly that it exudes a miasma of funk. 

I don’t know if her other books are funny but this one is grim.",0
"King's detailed characters in IT Hi! Hope everyone is having a great day!

I'm currently reading IT, I haven't read King in a while and couldn't help to notice that sometimes he seems to add detail after detail about characters, even secondary or even tertiary ones.  Personally I find some of this descriptions really interesting, perhaps more so by the fact that, as I'm not North American, those slices of life and customs are interesting to me.

But I completely understand that some people can be annoyed by these things, and in fact I think that a couple of paragraphs could be easily deleted and the story would be as good as it is.

What do you think about these aspect of King's writing? Do you like having large descriptions of his characters?",1
"Little details that break immersion: worth it to continue the book? (Sun Down Motel) So I just started reading The Sun Down Motel by Simone St. James, and was really enjoying the creepy atmosphere, when this passage took me out of it:

>It wasn't that impressive a place; Google Earth had told me that much. Downtown was a grid of cafes, laundromats, junky antique stores, apartment rental buildings, and used-book stores, nestled reverently around a grocery store and a CVS.

Used book stores? Most small towns in middle of nowhere America don't even have one book store, let alone several. What she is describing is a college town. Or a hippie/hipster town that's probably within driving distance of a college. Not your average shitty little upstate locale.

The last time I saw the author get a setting wrong like that was The Woman In the Window, and I just gave up on the book. With this one, I'm not so sure, because otherwise I really do like the author's writing style. How do you get past a dumb detail like that and regain confidence in the author and the story?

"Have you ever read a line in a book that has made you stop reading a book? I was reading Wilt by Tom Sharpe, which was--up to the point below--a farce about a mediocre man in extraordinary circumstances and then I came across this line.

>'Inspector,' said Wilt, 'if I acted upon every impulse that crossed my mind I would have been convicted of child rape, buggery, burglary, assault with intent to commit grievous bodily harm and mass murder long ago.'

Up to that point, Wilt is just a hapless man with a superiority complex in a dead-end job, who blames his wife for his meteoric mediocrity. The book has aged badly in its sexual politics and runs a bit close to the edge, but I think that was the closing point for me.

Has anyone else had a similar experience of a line coming out of the blue and closing the book?",0
"Books That Could Have Been Longer Without Compromising Quality I finished The Picture of Dorian Gray about 2 weeks ago and I couldn't get off my mind how quick it all felt, with all the time skips and plot points that are mentioned but not shown and especially the ending it made me think.

"One Series Changed The Way I Read Earlier this year, I finished the *Malazan Book of the Fallen* by Steven Erikson. If you've not heard of it, it's epic high fantasy with strong science fiction storytelling elements in a short story writing style. It is a long series (10 books, 3.325 million words total) and I'm glad/proud that I read it. Its reread is a matt or when, not if.

A few years ago when I got back into reading I was doing surface-level reading, not analysing the story at all. I wanted the story to be good without glaring plot holes. In honesty, I was content with it because I was back to doing something I deeply enjoy. After I read the Dresden Files (come on *Twelve Months*!), I listened to the Legendarium Blue Team coverage of Dresden and discovered their ""Three Levels."" 

Then, while I was reading *Toll The Hounds* (Malazan 8), it hit me how the whole series was ""journey, not destination."" Instead of barreling through the story to get to the end, I let myself soak in the story. I sat and thought about the ways the characters were impacted by events from five books ago and how continuing their stories had so much emotional depth. I think I had to renew the library loan two, almost three, times. Meanwhile, I was still reading my audiobooks and the occasional ebook.

A few months later I finished *Book of the Fallen*. It didn't ruin other books for me, but I knew I couldn't go back to reading only on the surface. I wanted it to be more than a ""ripping good yarn."" Not that those are bad, but it wasn't satiating my hunger the way it would have before.

I'm not looking for recommendations, I'm simply curious if anyone else has a specific book or series that did the same thing for them as *Book of the Fallen* did for me. Or, have you always been reading that way? I'd love to know.",1

"The Midnight Library (Matt Haig)... Does it get better? So... After some enthusiastic recommendations I bought a copy of The Midnight Library. I am 30 pages in now and I have to admit that I don't get it... The start is sooo superficial! Nora decides after a unlucky 24-hour period that life isn't worth it and just, whoop, decides that the best thing to do is to end it. In 22 pages Matt Haig crams in such a shaky exposition, which leaves me feeling no sympathy for the MC at all! It really falls short of the hellish experience that is an actual depression, what surprises me because Haig said he based the book om his own depressive episodes. The prose is mostly ""tell, dont show"" and I feel like that contributes to the superficial start of the book. I have the feeling that it is really overhyped and that I will not be able to finish it if it continues like this (which is really rare for me). 

Please please tell me it gets better! Or rip the bandaid off and tell me I should just give up.

"Do you ever feel nostalgia for the time you used to read certain books? I've been rereading ""Harry Potter"" and I feel this strong nostalgia for when I first read the books at 12 years old (I'm in my late 20s) and it's crazy how vividly they evoke that period of my life. Like smelling a grandparent's cooking and remembering your childhood, or listening to a song that you used to listen during a certain event. I remember being under a blanket, snow outside, reading HP by the Christmas tree lights. I seem to remember whole periods much clearer based on the books I used to read during those periods.

Some for me:

* **Anxious People by Fredrik Backman**. Not much really ""happens"" in this book other than painting the story of their characters and hearing about their development and relationships. I could totally see someone just not finding the characters likable enough to want to invest in their story.
* **The Harry Potter series.** I feel like if you didn't grow up with at least some HP related memories it's really hard to get into them as an adult. I've had people complain about the writing style of that it ""just felt like a children's book"" which is fair if you're expecting some profound life-changing epic. That's not what it's supposed to be, but I understand how people's perception of the books are very warped by the impact they had culturally and are disappointed when they start with Sorceror's Stone which is SUCH a whimsical book. 
* **Dark Places and Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn.** Gone Girl is her biggest hit for a reason because it teeters on the edge of a standard, dark mystery, but also dips its toes in the ""woahhh that is so fucked up"" realm. Dark Places and Sharp Objects definitely go a bit overboard in how almost creepy they are, but I enjoyed the plot of them and thought they were well done. But I also understand that someone might just be so turned off by some of the subject matter they'd be unable to get past that.",1
"I’ve just finished Pride and Prejudice I love this story, but I can now safely say I prefer the movie to the book. Austen’s writing (this may be according to her time) is the epitome of “telling” instead of “showing”, most of the times she recites a list of adjectives as characterization, and even though I can’t accuse her of not demonstrating what she claims a character to be (I had a lot of fun reading all of Mr Collins’ silly letters and pieces of dialogue), the lack of description is really detrimental to such a good story. Some story beats lacked the drama of revelation due to this, which I believe the movie to have shown in its full potential.",0
"What's your favorite ""coffee table"" book? As a photographer I tend to accumulate a lot of photography books, and many of them are those oversized books you'd probably consider ""coffee table"" books. So I have a number of really nice photography books, as well as several design-related books collecting posters, etc. 

I think my favorites though are probably those large collections you can often find at Barnes and Noble that showcase all the art in various famous museums, just because I can look at those over and over and never get sick of them. I also have a huge collection of Van Gogh's works, and a collection of Andrew Wyeth's Helga paintings. So I guess my favorites are all art books.

What are your favorites? What makes a good ""coffee table"" book? One thing that kills them for me is if they're too thick, which makes them difficult to read.",1
"Childhood’s End Appreciation I don’t remember where it was that I heard this book by Arthur C Clark mentioned but I am so glad I read it. It was entertaining all the way through and the way he writes about “Indescribable” experiences was so perfect.

I’ve always loved Weird Fiction but have a hard time finding books or stories I feel do it right. So many authors either go way into detail and ruin the mystery and impossibility of a thing or simply write something like “it was beyond words”.

Once again Childhoods End by Arthur C. Clark was excellent and I think a perfect example of describing the indescribable.",1
"Epilogues Alright, I definitely thought that I didn’t have a pet peeve when it came to reading. I enjoy books from multiple genres and nothing has really bothered me, until this week. 

In the last month I have read It Starts With Us (*gasp* a CoHo lover 😂) and Book Lovers by Emily Henry. Both books have these epilogues at the end with a fast forward glimpse of the future. It irks me that they are like “snapshots,” they are just too short! It makes the ending feel rushed and incomplete! 

Anybody else feel this way? Is it just this genre maybe? 

TL;DR: Short epilogues create abrupt endings that feel incomplete.",0
"Deep Storm by Lincoln Child - did anyone enjoy it as much as I did? It's an interesting book imo. A great book even, if you're not expecting too much (it's not exactly literature). It's got shades of *Sphere* by Michael Crichton and honestly I have trouble figuring out which I enjoyed more; it might actually be Deep Storm. The concepts are interesting and I honestly was not expecting the ending.",1
Just finished “Story of the Eye” by Georges Bataille.. wtf? I read this book today and I’m just curious if anyone in here has also read it and can give me what their interpretation/analysis of the book is? I think I may have to read it again to pick up on stuff but I honestly don’t really want to lmao it was pretty graphic. I know it’s all supposed to mean something but honestly I was really caught up in the grotesque and I think it may have all went over my head.,0
"What do you think about Black Senthuran (A black spirit memoir) by Akwaeke Emezi? I’ve been enjoying it so far. I felt some parts were speaking to me directly - the parts where they give advice to writers and about dealing with men. I also loved all the parts where they talk about their(romantic) desires and experiences with relationships because sometimes I could relate and other times it was just interesting to read their experience. The parts where they talk about how they grew up and her mental health were tough, but I really admire their ability to be able to talk about them. Sometimes I did find how they talked about themselves a bit arrogant and had trouble enjoying reading that but oh well! They’ve  made it clear they are a god so arrogance comes with it. I’m not completely done with the book but was woondering what other think about it. Let me know!",1
"Neuromancer isn’t as hard as I’ve heard… So before starting this book, I had seen all the comments on how it’s hard to read and you won’t fully understand what’s going on. I’m terms of plot, I am grasping it perfectly fine and I loveeee it. I’m terms of visualization, this is where I get a little confused. It’s described in a way that makes me think that you’re not supposed to get everything from the text and you kinda fill it out in your mind. Some descriptions aren’t very clear at all but taking from what’s in the text and imagining what makes sense in my mind works perfectly fine. 

This is my first dip into hard SF besides Dune but I’m a huge fantasy reader so maybe that’s why it isn’t as difficult as it feels similar to fantasy novels like Malazan and Stormlight where you’re just kinda thrown in and have to catch up. 

Am I missing something or is it just not as hard as everyone says lol. Anyway, I’m loving it so far it’s so atmospheric and I think the plot is interesting and explores many important ideas of technology and commentaries on the era it was written in politics.",1
"Ishmael Beah's A Long Way Gone and the Ethics of Consumption CW: death, mutilation, child abuse

&#x200B;

>We opened fire until the last living being in the other group fell to the ground. We walked toward the dead bodies, giving each other high fives. The group had also consisted of young boys like us, but we didn't care about them. We took their ammunition, sat on their bodies, and started eating the cooked food they had been carrying. All around us, fresh blood leaked from the bullet holes in their bodies.

A Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah, page 19

>One of the messengers was a young man. They had carved their initials, RUF (Revolutionary United Front), on his body with a hot bayonet and chopped off all his fingers with the exception of his thumbs. The rebels called this mutilation ""one love."" Before the war, people raised a thumb to say ""One love"" to each other, an expression popularized by the love and influence of reggae music.

A Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah, page 21

>One of them caught the fragments of the RPG. He cried out loudly and screamed that he was blind. No one dared to go out and help him. He was halted by another grenade that exploded, causing his remains and blood to sprinkle like rain on the nearby leaves and bushes.

A Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah, page 25

One must confront the ethics of spectatorship.

Important to do so because A Long Way Gone is not a novel, but a memoir. The experiences recorded in the book actually happened to its author, Ishmael Beah, who lived as a child soldier during the Sierra Leone Civil War, which lasted from 1991 to 2002. So when you read the above excerpts, you are not merely observing the artistry of a writer who believes one must confront brutal reality as it truly exists, but rather receiving brutal experiences in a mediated form, rendered palatable for your consumption. That is to say, in a way that will most likely not literally traumatize you.

In chapter two of his memoir, Ishmael Beah writes:

>These days I live in three worlds: my dreams, and the experiences of my new life, which trigger memories from the past.

I think it is clear, given the subject matter, that Beah means the word ""trigger"" in a clinical sense, not in the more colloquial form the word has taken in 2022 to mean ""offended."" That is, I believe that Beah is trying to communicate that he, like many soldiers, has PTSD due to his experiences. To set those experiences down is not uncomplicated, but ultimately an ethical and moral question that I leave to Beah without offering my judgment. I suspect he knows better than I do how the moral calculus shakes out.

Now, a slightly different moral calculus for his publishers. Because nobody should be naive enough to think that Farrar, Straus and Giroux published the book as a public service, or out of a deep-seated belief that they needed to offer witness to a series of atrocities with which, outside of their contact with this memoir, most of them probably simply weren't aware of. They published the memoir because they believed that it would be profitable to do so. Which makes a kind of market for the experiences of child soldiers. A brief Google search reveals *War Child* by Emmanuel Jal, published in 2010, two years after *A Long Way Gone*, *Soldier Boy* by Keely Hutton, published in 2018, and *Walk Toward the Rising Sun* by Ger Duany in 2020.

Difficult to know what to do with this information. On the one hand, I certainly don't want to suggest that boys and/or men who have been child soldiers don't have the right to share their experiences with the world. But I do wonder if the publishers are not engaging in a kind of war profiteering by taking advantage of these men in order to make money at a much higher rate than the authors are likely to. On the other hand, it may be a greater economic opportunity for these men than they are likely to find elsewhere, given that if a book sells well, it can be a life-changing affair. I don't believe it's my business to decide whether one can sell one's life experiences. But I do wonder about who's doing the selling and whether there is not some unreckoned cost to selling a traumatic experience for a mass market.

Which brings us to the larger question, which is: who is doing the consuming and why? I got the book from a library because it had a spot on a larger list of literature claiming to be the ""best"" literature ever written. So, the fact that I'm reading a memoir about a child soldier is more or less incidental. It's not something I sought out, but rather something I came into contact with as a product of the mechanics of a personal project. But there do exist people who seek out this kind of book.

The ethics of consumption, as it is broadly understood, generally holds that ""purchasers in markets consume not only goods but also, implicitly, the process used to produce them."" Does that mean that the purchasers of child soldier memoirs implicitly endorse wars involving child soldiers? Certainly, the Sierra Leone Civil War qualifies as a process that produced *A Long Way Gone*. On the other hand, it seems relatively unlikely, given that the recruitment of child soldiers is a practice that enlists its victims in a form of involuntary servitude, that the material support of ex-child soldiers will lead to more children seeking to become child soldiers in order to profit from it in the form of a book deal ten to twenty years down the line. Which would mean that: *not all processes that produce a given good for consumption are endorsed by their consumers.*

Rather, we might take the question of the ethics of consumption to refer specifically to manufacturing processes, which is to say that by purchasing books, we consume not only the book, but also endorse the process of deforestation that creates them (which happens, actually, to be true). But does this actually satisfy our question of who is the consumer of child soldier memoirs and why? Clearly not.

Difficult to ignore that there is a potentially salacious quality to the book project, among readers looking for a kind of brute-force contact with atrocity because of the dopamine or adrenaline hit they get from such contact. The habitual consumers of true crime, for instance. This kind of reader wants to read the book *because* the violence in it is real, and they get some kind of satisfaction from coming into contact with such violence. I wouldn't go so far as to call them vicarious sadists (at least, I hope, most of them), but they are sensationalist readers. Difficult to acknowledge this kind of reader without some level of condemnation. We recognize that the violence of the world does not exist simply to satisfy some people's hunger for reality.

But how do they stack up against the simply curious? Certainly, one can imagine a reader who, having heard about child soldiers on NPR or their chosen podcast, decides to read a book about it simply to get a better idea of what's involved with child soldiering. This seems, to me, to be largely value-neutral. We've got to come to know things, somehow, and books are as good a method as anything else to accomplish this goal. This person might be shocked by how graphic the passages are that I've quoted above, and, certainly, if it motivates a kind of political action, like donating to [UNICEF](https://www.unicefusa.org/mission/emergencies/child-refugees-and-migrants?form=FUNSUJMLZDZ&utm_content=sitelinkmakedonation_E2001&ms=cpc_dig_2020_Brand_20200109_google_sitelinkmakedonation_delve_E2001&initialms=cpc_dig_2020_Brand_20200109_google_sitelinkmakedonation_delve_E2001&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkpPXKjY6BBok2ACNjCCmSU6Uaj6n_5tWDZd5nT9Q5fQHuj7RP-YS-IaAhfaEALw_wcB) (the organization that rescued Beah), their readership might even be net-positive. Still, if they read through the book and, at the end of it, put it down, content in the knowledge that they now know more about child soldiering than they did at the beginning—and are now capable of wielding that knowledge at, say, a dinner party, in order to make conversation, gain social advantage, etc., do we really give the strictly curious reader a pass? Or can we admit that the violence of the world does not exist to satisfy a hunger for reality, but neither does it exist to satisfy someone's curiosity.

Then, there is, of course (and this group is the least suspect of any that I'll mention), the people of Sierra Leone, whether in diasporas abroad or in their home country, or other African countries where child soldiers were employed, like Sudan or Uganda, or even other ex-child soldiers, who might read this book and receive some kind of solace understanding that their experiences have been recorded, their pain shared, that they no longer walk unaccompanied through the mists of history but have, for the first time, some kind of guide or fellow wanderer. I have no criticism to offer such readers. It seems clear that the ethics of accessing a shared experience through literature are in no way fraught. In fact, Beah dedicates his book to the children of Sierra Leone. This is his intended audience. It also bears mentioning that I believe this is the smallest class of reader.

Finally, I think, there is a reader who feels ethically *compelled* to read *A Long Way Gone,* who is not merely curious or seeking thrills, but has a kind of political consciousness of the world that requires them to expose themselves to the reality of the violence of the world *because* they are the enemy of that violence. But, even though I think that, with the exception of our third category of reader (those with a shared experience), this is the most palatable kind of reader, since they are unlikely to take any *pleasure* in reading the book, intellectual or sensual or otherwise, I think they are fooling themselves by thinking that they are learning anything about real violence by reading this book, or even standing in solidarity with the people who did experience that violence simply by reading about it. Yes, it may be useful and instructive when it comes to evaluating the privilege of our own lives and orienting ourselves to the problems we face in the world, but, of course, real violence cannot be translated to the page. It exists only in the lives and minds of those who suffer it.

It is unclear what to do with all of this. Do I think that we simply ought not to read the book? Not at all. I intend to read it, as real as its violence may be, and even though I am suspicious of my own motivations as a reader. I will attempt to allow its contents to instruct me in my own life, the same way I read every book. I see no reason why, in a world where child soldiering exists, my conscience should somehow remain clean.",0
"Is all ""business"" non-fiction like this? \~6 years out of an English major and just starting to get into the ""business"" category of non-fiction. Five books on my target list in--does it seem to anyone else like the majority of these 200-400 pg books mentioned on the business/entrepreneurship podcast circuit could be condensed into 30-40 page summaries of analysis where the author is seeing a common thread (eg, working Wed-Sat is more productive or something like that)? The majority of these books on work techniques, productivity, or business pop psychology repeatedly come off as mildly researched formulas of anecdote/pop culture reference + summarizing a study from HBS or an organizational psych team + practical recommendation that was probably already obvious to most people who have any sort of lived experience. Specifically, I'm thinking about Malcolm Gladwell, Daniel Pink, James Clear, and Tim Ferriss.",0
"Understanding the Great Gabsty Just started reading the Great Gabsty and I’m not sure I know what’s going on? The setting for example, I’m confuse on where they’re at and what they’re doing but it seems like they’re partying? When it comes to the long descriptive paragraph I get lost. The only time I can probably understand what’s going on is they’re conversations. Even then I ask myself how did we get here and what started this? I’ve heard it’s an easy read and it probably is but I’m not hooked on it yet. I really would like to understand the character traits more because I do believe they have some interesting characters that can help contribute understanding the story. Such as Daisy, I have no clue who she is, Myrtle I feel like I have somewhat of an idea what her personality is and the person she is. Tom I gotta get grip on the kind of person he is and Nick to me is just there despite being the narrator. I’m only on chapter 2 so I’m still giving this book a chance but so far I’m just reading words. Anyone who read this who struggled understanding care to explain why? Or will it’ll eventually start to fit together later in the story?",0
"Black No More by George S. Schuyler I just finished this book, and surprisingly I couldn't find a post here where it was commented.

Has anyone read it? what do you think about it?",1
"Does Ready Player One get any better? I've read through the first few chapters and it feels like all of reddit collectively wrote the book. It has made me audibly groan a couple times already. I almost threw the book across the room when a character unironically said 'Shut your hole, Penisville'. It legitimately reads like a middle-grade book sometimes. I know the narrator is supposed to be in highschool, but I've never heard someone talk like this in real life. Is this some sort of elaborate shitpost or do people genuinely like this book?",0
"Is Elinor Lipman a tad antifeminist? I read *Turpentine Lane* and thought I had discovered a new writer of lighter fare, but now I'm not so sure whether she isn't also a bit antifeminist.

I'm not quite halfway through *The View From Penthouse B* which involves a woman divorced from a narcissistic predatory creep who is slowly worming his way back into her life.  The distressing part is that I think we're supposed to see her as admirable and gracious for giving him comfort, whilst he also crosses her boundaries.  

Also, this woman (and her sister) take in a new roommate who is also bullying her and constantly disregarding her boundaries, but I think we're supposed to see him as spirited and adding life to apartment.   

Things have just felt very off with this particular book and I'd like some other opinions.",1

"The Sanatorium by Sarah Pearce.. Can someone please explain the damn epilogue???
Who was that watching her on the lift at the end?? Issac or Haler? It’s never explained..

I could see the author writing that in the epilogue if there were to be a direct sequel of this novel but it really just confused me on where I thought this book was going.

Also I don’t understand who pushed Elin into the pool. Apparently it was Laure but according to the epilogue it’s not?


Idk. This book was entertaining but all over the place. I enjoyed it but now that I finished and reflect back on it I’m left more confused than anything…",1
"Belladona book by Adalyn Grace I can't shut up about this book. Is there any other woman out there, that is swooning so hard about the main character ? It seems I can't even function normally. I just want to die to be in the place of Signa Farrow.. Help!

Can I please discuss this book in detail with someone so obsessed as me ? 

It's strange how I'm diagnosed with depression, I go through hell and back with the side effects, feelings of emptiness, of not belonging and this book literally falls into my hands. 

I was in a bookstore, checking for a new book as I finished Verity and I found it at least intermediate level..  and felt like some scify or fantasy.. I picked up some other book, randomly, because I liked the cover it had. Even tho I wasn't really sure about it, but I always end up loving the books and the characters I read. I sat on the chair before the English book section and looked, rested.. and suddenly I see a belladona.. and I'm like, oj well, I love the name.. let me see. I loved the cover as it is covered in the berries, leaves birds.. basically it looked like tattoo and I found that appealing. 

I quickly checked the reviews of the book and seen a comment : Gothic, mysterious, romantic.. and I was like.. yep, my kind of vibe. 

I didn't know I'm going to fall in love with everything that was included in it. And I'm hoping I'll find someone with similar experience and maybe start a discussion together, bringing out details, visions, fan art... 

I'll be looking forward to hear from all of you, who've read Belladonna and fell in love. :))",1
"You’re Wearing That? by Deborah Tannen 
You’re Wearing That? by Deborah Tannen gave some solid insight into the complicated communication dynamics of intimate familial relationships. It focuses mainly on the mother-daughter dynamic giving insight into why communication can be so emotionally charged between mothers and daughters.

What really stuck with me was how the author addressed meta messages or meta meanings. I’d seen this topic addressed in a viral thread about “ask culture” versus “guess culture”. Tannen explains how exclaiming that “guess culture” is wrong and that the more direct “ask culture” *makes more sense* ignores the fact that there really are two forms of communication happening in any given conversation. And that the longer the relationship of the two people speaking the more likely there are messages that belie what’s explicitly said (meta messages/meanings).

The closeness and length of a relationship make any conversation automatically more of a “minefield” due to intimate knowledge and shared experiences.

It was really interesting reading about the reasons why conversations with my parents can trigger such an emotional response even though to an outsider nothing deserving of such a reaction was said.

I really recommend this book if you find that your communication with your mother in particular tends to be more frustrating and upsetting than enjoyable and intimate.",1
"The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah I quit. I can not torture myself anymore. I’ve made two attempts at reading this book. First attempt I read about 10% of the book. Second attempt I got 70% of the way and I just decided I can’t continue.

"Dune - book & movie At the outset, I am not sure whether this belongs in the r/books or r/movies. Having finished dune recently, I just want a space to share my thoughts. So here I go - I saw the movie before reading the book and I absolutely loved it! So i decided to read the book, honestly because I wanted to live in the Dune world for a bit longer.

The thanksgiving weekend came at a perfect time. I was on a road trip and I used all my driving time to finish the audiobook(Also, Dune audiobook is a real piece of work with alot of production value). The movie has done a great justice to the first book. 
The way they set the scene up, adding depth to most characters, even the dialogues were amazing. My fav scenes were the spice collection and the majestic sandworm, just wow!

I would say some aspects had greater gravitas in the book- the desperation for water on Arakis. The book took its sweet time to explain the stillsuits, all the fremen ways to save every drop of water. Brilliantly written!

Overall, I am so excited to start Messiah. I can only imagine it gets better as Paul learns the fremen ways!

P.s - to all who have read all the dune books and seen the movie, do Paul's dreams have any significance to the story?  I had so many questions about the dreams show in the movie, so i thought the book would answer them-😆 (im not worried about spoilers so please go ahead)",1
"read plenty depressing RUS novels, but wanted to read some Ukrainian literature 'cause. so I just finished ""The Orphange"" by Serhiy Zhadan the first thing that hits you are the similes.  
the author peppers them into his prose like seasoning trying to hide the taste of rotting meat.
They grate on you like sandpaper across your knuckles are first, but eventually you get used to them, like a broken-in pair of leather shoes.  Comfortable.  Reliable.  Keeping you connected with the journey.  

(I half-jest and am half-serious.  my sense of humor is a bit strange.  anyhow...)  

It was suggested to me that I might be more familiar with Russian novels and not Ukrainian novels because the was an empire pushing the former and actively suppressing the latter.
But the latter really shouldn't be neglected, not because there is a war on (though that's a good reason...) but just because it's good.  All the Russian novelist fell out of Gogol's overcoat anyway.  

Zhadan is a lot more modern than Gogol, and the orphanage is a lot more meaningful than his coat.  The protagonist sets off on a foolhardy journey to pick up his nephew from an orphanage in another city, but he leaves too late and finds the world shifting beneath his feet.  

I can't speak about how well the novel reflects Ukraine or anything like that, I don't know whether the translation honestly reflects the author's intent (though the World Republic of Letters translation resulted in some page-turnning prose in any case).  But I can say the novel is a powerful statement of humanity.  of humans just getting by.  of humans following orders.  of humans doing what they can.  and of humans not bothering at all.  I wasn't sure what I was expecting getting into it.  But I was glad I came out of it.    

The narrators comments on the protagonist are interesting to watch.  I never felt the narrator really considered what he does or the choices he is currently making, just his attitude towards it all.  The end sorta justified him though.  

I don't know where I am going with this, but I wanted to share.  Hope you read it and it moves you, too.",1
Hard Times - Thoughts A shorter book by Charles Dickens and not as detailed and intricately woven story as the other books of his I’ve read. Definitely a simpler plot but still a good read and an interesting take on logical vs emotion and favoring one of the two for ones world view. I wouldn’t say it’s one of his best books but I did find the characters very intriguing. I enjoyed the overall plot but I never felt it truly griped me like his other works. Though Luisas role definitely is the most convicting. I wish there had been a little more public humiliation for Mr Bounderby at the end. Overall a good book but not one of my favorites by him. I would give it a 7.3,1
