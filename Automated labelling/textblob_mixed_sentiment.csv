"What would you say is the ideal age to read The Phantom Tollbooth? My 11 year old was assigned it this year in school, so I downloaded the audiobook and was pretty delighted with the wordplay but I think the concepts are a bit beyond him.  He's no genius, but he's no dummy either, but I just think a lot of this is going to shoot right over his head.

The wordplay reminded me a lot of L. Frank Baums Oz books.  I especially liked the word arithmagician.",0,0.5392857142857143,1,0.5392857142857143
"Is Dostojevsky a bad author? I was expecting a great read when I borrowed Dostoevskys ""Notes from the underground"" but when I started reading it felt like swimming through mud. I thought he was supposed to be a great thinker and author but now I'm not so sure on the author part. Pleas help me understand. I want to enjoy his work.",0,0.36000000000000004,1,0.36000000000000004
"""What am I missing with this book?"" thread! I just finished reading Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler. I love sci fi and I know this one is hugely acclaimed but it just didn't click with me. I found the MC a bit cloyingly perfect and the other characters bland. I felt like I was reading a mission statement rather than a novel. 

Whenever I read a super famous book like this and don't get it, I always end up wishing I could understand WHY people love it so much. 

So, post the acclaimed books you read and just didn't quite ""get"", and others can answer and attempt to explain what it is about these books that makes them so beloved, with the goal of trying to change your perspective on it!",0,0.3424242424242424,1,0.3424242424242424
"I am Pilgrim - Terry Hayes I picked this book up after seeing it recommended my many many people at the bookstores. Am up to Chapter 23 and I just don’t get the appeal - I find the narrator to be annoyingly perfect (or a bit archetypal - he’s like Batman). I’m irritated by the characterisations of women (with far too  much implied sexual violence even given the setting of the story) and well … I don’t feel particularly enthusiastic about continuing.

Does it get better? Other than the short chapters, I’m not sure when or why I’m supposed to “find this un-putdown-able”",0,0.3204545454545455,1,0.3204545454545455
"Understanding the Great Gabsty Just started reading the Great Gabsty and I’m not sure I know what’s going on? The setting for example, I’m confuse on where they’re at and what they’re doing but it seems like they’re partying? When it comes to the long descriptive paragraph I get lost. The only time I can probably understand what’s going on is they’re conversations. Even then I ask myself how did we get here and what started this? I’ve heard it’s an easy read and it probably is but I’m not hooked on it yet. I really would like to understand the character traits more because I do believe they have some interesting characters that can help contribute understanding the story. Such as Daisy, I have no clue who she is, Myrtle I feel like I have somewhat of an idea what her personality is and the person she is. Tom I gotta get grip on the kind of person he is and Nick to me is just there despite being the narrator. I’m only on chapter 2 so I’m still giving this book a chance but so far I’m just reading words. Anyone who read this who struggled understanding care to explain why? Or will it’ll eventually start to fit together later in the story?",0,0.26888888888888896,1,0.26888888888888896
"Thoughts on abandoning a book halfway through? What are your thoughts on quitting a book halfway through if it isn't turning out to be as engaging as you thought it would be? How many of you would see it through, and how many of you would just say, ""Life's too short,"" and move on?

I ask you this because I've come across too many books lately that I feel like I'm wasting my time on, and I can't figure out whether it's because I might be suffering from attention issues, or because I'm just choosing books I shouldn't be. 

I'm currently reading Where the Crawdads Sing, and it's just unending torment with every passing paragraph.

I also quit American Psycho halfway through because it wasn't able to retain my interest after a certain point. And that's a movie I actually enjoyed watching!

Does anybody else deal with this dilemma?",0,0.26720779220779217,1,0.26720779220779217
"The Midnight Library (Matt Haig)... Does it get better? So... After some enthusiastic recommendations I bought a copy of The Midnight Library. I am 30 pages in now and I have to admit that I don't get it... The start is sooo superficial! Nora decides after a unlucky 24-hour period that life isn't worth it and just, whoop, decides that the best thing to do is to end it. In 22 pages Matt Haig crams in such a shaky exposition, which leaves me feeling no sympathy for the MC at all! It really falls short of the hellish experience that is an actual depression, what surprises me because Haig said he based the book om his own depressive episodes. The prose is mostly ""tell, dont show"" and I feel like that contributes to the superficial start of the book. I have the feeling that it is really overhyped and that I will not be able to finish it if it continues like this (which is really rare for me). 

Please please tell me it gets better! Or rip the bandaid off and tell me I should just give up.

"Does Ready Player One get any better? I've read through the first few chapters and it feels like all of reddit collectively wrote the book. It has made me audibly groan a couple times already. I almost threw the book across the room when a character unironically said 'Shut your hole, Penisville'. It legitimately reads like a middle-grade book sometimes. I know the narrator is supposed to be in highschool, but I've never heard someone talk like this in real life. Is this some sort of elaborate shitpost or do people genuinely like this book?",0,0.2642857142857143,1,0.2642857142857143
"Lolita: Am I missing something? Okay, I get it, the prose is great. Nabokov is clearly an extremely talented writer. But I don't really care how beautiful the writing is when i realize I've just read 3 entire pages of a nearly 40 year old man jerking off next to a 12 year old, talking about how he's going to ""preserve her innocence"" by molesting her in her sleep. And then part 2 of the book is just long winded descriptions of various American landmarks and secluded cabins. 

At no point have I felt sympathy for Humbert, at no point have I even found him ""unreliable"" as everyone loves to say - he's very aware that he's a pervert and very aware that Dolores is unhappy. 

What am I missing? What is it about this book that people love? It's literally always mentioned in ""best books I've ever read"" lists and I genuinely don't get it.",0,0.23095238095238102,1,0.23095238095238102
"I’ve just finished Pride and Prejudice I love this story, but I can now safely say I prefer the movie to the book. Austen’s writing (this may be according to her time) is the epitome of “telling” instead of “showing”, most of the times she recites a list of adjectives as characterization, and even though I can’t accuse her of not demonstrating what she claims a character to be (I had a lot of fun reading all of Mr Collins’ silly letters and pieces of dialogue), the lack of description is really detrimental to such a good story. Some story beats lacked the drama of revelation due to this, which I believe the movie to have shown in its full potential.",0,0.2204545454545455,1,0.2204545454545455
"It Can’t Happen Here, really hard to follow at first I’m trying to read this book and idk if I’m alone here but it feels like the first 6 chapters is just introducing character after character with nothing actually happening except character introductions. I can’t keep track of this many people unless I make a spread sheet. Hopefully it will get better because the book has a lot of praise but right now I’m just struggling.",0,0.21343537414965988,1,0.21343537414965988
"Do you read newly released books, or do you stick to the classics? My fiancée loves contemporary poplit authors like Coleen Hoover and books like The Love Hypothesis and Where the Crawdads Sing. 

Most poplit doesn’t appeal to me—I reached this conclusion after reading the drivel that was Ready Player One (just my opinion, I don’t mind if you like it). I think, ultimately, that I believe every great story has already been written. So why try to find something new?

After reading RP1, I decided to try and go back in time, and this began a newfound journey to read the time-tested examples of storytelling through the western canon (I’d like to get into more Japanese authors as well, but I’m keeping it to LATAM/American/English authors for now). 

I know there’s no accounting for taste, and I’m just glad my fiancée reads books at all. But I’ve found it hard to truly love any contemporary books. I suppose that’s the rub, though: today’s books haven’t been around long enough to be inserted into the canon. 

By “today’s books” I guess I mean everything post/internet, as I believe the internet has changed humanity’s relationship with the written word. It’s great as a search tool, but maybe the overall quality of writing among the blockbuster books of the day are in decline compared to yesterday. 

I also think contemporary fiction tends to emphasize plot over characters or themes. Personally, those things are my jam, and that’s why I’m looking forward to reading Cormac McCarthy’s latest books (ironically enough). Any recommendations your have for contemporary books in this vein, I’ll take them!

I’m rambling now, but I’ll pose the question—do you tend to gravitate toward “canonized” literature, or do you like to keep up with what’s popular now? Or do you not fret about that stuff in general?",0,0.20631764069264066,1,0.20631764069264066
