"Trauma, Dissociation, and The Time Traveler's Wife CW: dissociation, violent death

One of my beliefs about literature is that it's complex—maybe more complex than one person can process. That's because, when we read, our minds are temporarily jacked in to another person's stream of consciousness. A prepared, orchestrated consciousness, but nonetheless a set of thoughts that came from another mind, which are now being ""broadcast"" into our minds. But, of course, our minds wander; certain words may trigger different associations for different readers; certain events may trigger different memories. So a text is never just the words on paper, and trying to claim that a text means just one thing is, by definition, a doomed enterprise.

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about literature and, to my mind, the highest study of literature comes in the form of conversations between readers that share the details and interpretations of the different readings of a text so that everybody can gain a deeper knowledge and appreciation of how rich and complex the literature we love actually is.

So, bearing that in mind, here is an interpretation:

>>!""We hit the truck practically in slow motion, or so it seemed to me. In actuality, we were going about forty. The truck was an open pickup truck full of scrap metal. When we hit it, a large sheet of steel flew off the back of the truck, came through our windshield, and decapitated my mother.""!<

[The Time Traveler's Wife](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookpunk/collection/f1bb4c32-93e7-4f25-9b16-0d38441fe64a) by Audrey Niffenegger, pages 111-12

[The Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dissociative-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20355215) defines three different types of dissociative disorders: dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder (or DID), and depersonalization-derealization disorder. All three disorders are considered to be responses to post-traumatic stress, especially resulting from trauma experienced as a child.

The Mayo Clinic defines dissociative amnesia as: ""memory loss that's more severe than normal forgetfulness and that can't be explained by a medical condition,"" an inability to ""recall information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a traumatic time."" Henry>!loses ten minutes and forty-seven seconds of his memory, immediately after witnessing his mother's decapitation and nearly losing his own life. During this time, he is physically transported from the site of the accident to an unknown location (though I suspect the subject will be treated later in the novel, I just haven't gotten to it yet). That is, his time-traveling, or chrono-impairment, acts as a post-traumatic response similar to dissociative amnesia. It is a physical manifestation of a mental disorder.!<

The Mayo Clinic defines depersonalization as: ""an ongoing or episodic sense of detachment or being outside yourself — observing your actions, feelings, thoughts and self from a distance as though watching a movie."" We can see one example of depersonalization when >!Henry encounters his younger self in the Field Museum after his younger self time travels for the first time (which must surely have been traumatic). In the case of the accident that kills his mother, Henry undergoes a kind of ""hyper-depersonalization,"" where he not only ""observ\[es\] \[his\] actions ... and self from a distance,"" but actually observes himself from many different vantage points and distances. !<

But Henry doesn't only depersonalize; he experiences>! his return to the scene of the accident as a kind of post-traumatic flashback. He time travels to the accident ""\[o\]ver and over"" He is ""in cars, behind bushes, on the bridge, in a tree."" He has ""seen it from every angle."" And like many sufferers of post-traumatic stress, his mother's death becomes for him ""the pivotal thing."" !<

>!Of course, the difference between Henry and the ordinary sufferers of depersonalization is that he can actually interact with his younger self in the moment of his trauma. He calls his father with a message to go to the hospital, puts a blanket around his younger self's shoulders.!< This is the fantasy of trauma: that, given the chance, we would go back and change things for our younger self. But the cost of doing so is that Henry>!must experience the moment of his mother's death over and over again. His time-travel becomes a vehicle for the expression of a mental illness that centripetally compels him to the same point in time over and over again. And there are real limits to what he can do to help himself in the past, as the book illustrates time and time again when emphasizing the theme of determinism. He cannot actually do anything to keep his mother from dying. !<

Mental illnesses are often complex and difficult to understand, even (or especially) for the people who suffer from them, but Niffenegger seems to have dramatized two such illnesses in the form of Henry's time-traveling >!repeatedly back to the site of his mother's death.!< She imagines a world where the operations of our mind can be externalized and seen, written into space-time as a form of >!eternal return to our trauma,!< but also a world where we are equipped >!to provide small comforts to our traumatized selves.

"Ideology and Imagining Death in Sebastian Junger's The Perfect Storm >""I had pictures of what happened, images: Bobby and Sully and Murph just bug-eyed, knowing this is the final moment, looking at each other and this jug of booze goin' around real fast because they're tryin' to numb themselves out, and then Bobby goes flyin' and Sully goes under. But what was the final moment? What was the final, final thing?""

*The Perfect Storm* by Sebastian Junger, page 168

The above quotation is the response of Christina Cotter, the girlfriend of one of the men on board the *Andrea Gail* during the ""perfect storm"" from which the book derives its title\*,\* to the death of her boyfriend Bobby Shatford. In it, we find an ordinary woman's attempt to grapple with the loss of a loved one to the senseless violence of a natural disaster.

Anybody who has experienced the loss of a loved one to violence will recognize the gesture, the desire to pull into visibility to last moments of the deceased. Like Christina, we might imagine the event in the third-person, as though we were there and somehow immune to the violence, giving our attention wholly to the loved one with no thought of ourselves. This is, in a sense, a fantasy: the myth of a passive spectator. Like a kind of guardian angel, we can watch over the beloved and accompany them through the final trial of their lives.

More difficult to imagine the violence in the first-person. Even if we have experienced violence in the past, we can't imagine what it might feel like for *another person* to endure it. Some people describe their violent recollections as terrifying; Ernie Hazard, another victim of shipwreck in *The Perfect Storm* describes his own close call with death as ""business-like."" Impossible to know with which of these extremes—or where in the middle—our loved one's experience correlates.

But, of course, we run up against the wall of ""the final, final thing.""

I take *The Perfect Storm* to be a book concerned with speculating about death: both how death happens and what death means. Since anyone who has read the book jacket knows that the crew of the *Andrea Gail* ""disappeared without a trace,"" even the most ordinary passages of the book come to take on a doomed aspect. Our imagination of death begins with a recounting of the banal details of life. We know how the story ends; the question is how we get there.

I think I know why Christina Cotter has a vested interest in imagining the details of her boyfriend's death. I take it to be a kind of trauma response. She wants to mentally recreate a moment in her boyfriend's life so that, the fantasy goes, she can empathize and connect with him. The experience of doing so is, strictly speaking, horrific; we are rarely comforted by our imagination of death. Christina's own attempt at the act only leads her to a question, ""What was the final, final thing?"" because that is where her imagination fails. She can imagine everything up until death itself. What she really wants, I suspect, might be to go past death so that she can still be with her boyfriend wherever he is now (if, indeed, one believes that he is anywhere at all).

Given that *The Perfect Storm* dedicates an entire chapter (""The Zero-Moment Point"") to exhaustively imagining the deaths of the six men who perished aboard the *Andrea Gail,* down to describing, biologically, what is happening to their bodies during the different stages of drowning, I take it that Christina is not alone in wanting to imagine the death of her boyfriend. Reading generously, I suspect that Junger's motivation is not to luridly dramatize those deaths for the purposes of entertainment, but rather to try, in some small way, to understand the crew's suffering, the senselessness of their deaths.

He hedges his prose with what ""could have"" happened, rather than trying to write the definitive version of events. Even his descriptions of drowning are delivered in a clinical, rather than a sensationalist, tone. He speaks of what ""the body"" does, abstractly, as it drowns. This is ideology. Rather than the failure of the imagination that Christina experiences, Junger replaces the uncertainty of how the individual experiences death with a surrogate: what happens, mechanically, as the body shuts down. In Junger's version, the ""final, final thing"" reads:

>The electrical activity in their brain gets weaker and weaker until, after fifteen or twenty minutes, it ceases all together.

*The Perfect Storm* by Sebastian Junger, page 146

But this is only the pretense of knowledge, a substitute for the information that Christina Cotter tries to summon when she imagines the crew's final moments. However, I take the substitution to be a practical one: Junger is no more capable of imagining their deaths than Christina is. (And, indeed, maybe less so, since she actually knew the men.) And yet, even though the fascination is morbid, there is something about the clinical description that appeals to the reader. It offers an abstracted portrait of the deaths of six men—and promises that our own death, when it comes, will be, in some small way, knowable.",1,-38.0,0,38.0,169
"Do you read newly released books, or do you stick to the classics? My fiancée loves contemporary poplit authors like Coleen Hoover and books like The Love Hypothesis and Where the Crawdads Sing. 

Most poplit doesn’t appeal to me—I reached this conclusion after reading the drivel that was Ready Player One (just my opinion, I don’t mind if you like it). I think, ultimately, that I believe every great story has already been written. So why try to find something new?

After reading RP1, I decided to try and go back in time, and this began a newfound journey to read the time-tested examples of storytelling through the western canon (I’d like to get into more Japanese authors as well, but I’m keeping it to LATAM/American/English authors for now). 

I know there’s no accounting for taste, and I’m just glad my fiancée reads books at all. But I’ve found it hard to truly love any contemporary books. I suppose that’s the rub, though: today’s books haven’t been around long enough to be inserted into the canon. 

By “today’s books” I guess I mean everything post/internet, as I believe the internet has changed humanity’s relationship with the written word. It’s great as a search tool, but maybe the overall quality of writing among the blockbuster books of the day are in decline compared to yesterday. 

I also think contemporary fiction tends to emphasize plot over characters or themes. Personally, those things are my jam, and that’s why I’m looking forward to reading Cormac McCarthy’s latest books (ironically enough). Any recommendations your have for contemporary books in this vein, I’ll take them!

I’m rambling now, but I’ll pose the question—do you tend to gravitate toward “canonized” literature, or do you like to keep up with what’s popular now? Or do you not fret about that stuff in general?",0,35.0,1,35.0,151
"The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy I shared my thoughts on ""The Road"" a while back, and after being recommended ""The Crossing"" by a fellow Redditor, I thought I'd post a follow-up. 

I'll start as bluntly as possible. The Road gutted me like a cold, dry fish. I loved it from start to finish and hated it for the way it made me feel, and that is quite a rare combination. I'll also likely never forget that book. Still, after hearing about The Crossing, I was understandably excited. It wouldn't be the same, sure, but I had high hopes for more in the way of subtle human desperation and raw emotion. Thus, I jumped straight in and got to it. 

I'll be honest, the first fourth of the book had me hooked. I felt for the boy. I felt for his struggles, his anxiety, his faux masculinity, and the wolf by his side. I'm a firm believer that if the reader knows something bad's coming, but they don't know when then you're doing dread a great service. The Crossing, however, wasn't that. Sure, the wolf died, fast, relatively painlessly, and in a way, beautifully. Then, more purple prose and self-masturbatory wordsmithery than I've ever read, ever, combined. I had to stop after a good twenty pages and think about what was happening. Was there a message buried beneath this torrent of ""a man is only as worthy as his X"" tangents? A bunch of tragic and thoughtful metaphors perhaps? Because come on, surely this story can't simply devolve into minor story beats accompanied by string after string of further ""a life worth living isn't an X"" cleverness? Sadly, yes. Yes, it did. 

I tried to love this book, and at first, I did. Don't get me wrong, it's not poorly written. It's purple, definitely, and I'm fine with that. But there's just something self-serving about it, to a distracting extent. It's like a poem that draws intrigue from your very soul only to continue waxing depth while trying to impress you for another 1900 lines. How I thought, how can I care about these boys so deeply, and so quickly, only to wish they'd reach a destination, an ending, anything significant before I strangle them with my own hands? 

I'd love to discuss the book. I didn't care for it in the end, but that's why I'm here. 

Finally, I'm aware that The Crossing is part of a trilogy.",0,28.0,1,28.0,276

"Reading “I’m Glad My Mom Died” soon after my own mom died. I had a very tense relationship with my mom and she died unexpectedly this year. Jennette McCurdy’s book came out shortly after her funeral and I considered reading it right away but thought it would be better for my mental health to wait a few months. Last week I decided it was time. I finished it in less than a day.

I’ve struggled with an eating disorder since I was in high school. My mom, though she was a good person, had her own issues with food and was one of the main causes of my bulimia. She was also very religious. I think my own childhood helped me to view McCurdy’s memoir through a different lens. I know what religious trauma can do to you. I know how eating disorders can easily be sparked by some careless words and nurtured by family members. I know how confusing it is when a parent dies and you have conflicting emotions about it. Ungenerous thoughts you’re afraid to even admit. 

McCurdy’s description of the days surrounding her mom’s death hit me hard. Some chapters could’ve been taken from my journal. It’s odd to have such a similar experience as a complete stranger. I laughed, I cried, and I gritted my teeth to get through this book. Part of me is glad I choose to read it after all and part of me wishes I never picked it up.  

Have any of you had a similar experience with this memoir? Or any another book where you read it at a time in your life when it aligned closely with what was happening to you and was a very emotional read for you?",1,-26.0,0,26.0,230
"I had to read The Death of Ivan Iliych for one of my classes this semester. I expected it to be a drag but it legitimately hit me hard It's a very short book at about 50 some odd pages, but considering I was juggling it in the same semester as Calc II, Biochem, and JPN III, it seemed like nothing but a time waste (my fault for taking a philosophy class during a dense semester), but I actually ended up loving it so much I read the entire thing in one sitting despite it being broken up in the syllabus over 3 weeks. 

Ivan was far from being any sort of sympathetic character, and even at the end of the book I found myself not feeling bad for him, but the ideas and concepts brought up in the book are what hooked and affected me. The idea that no matter how much money or man power you throw at it, death inevitably comes for us all. The pain of needing to still exist despite knowing your end is soon, the anguish of realizing all you ever wanted or achieved is for nothing, the reality of being alone in death, and swiftly being forgotten afterwards, it's so crushing man like holy hell.

My entire philosophy class was focused on the concept of death and dying, but this book in particular is what I really took to heart from the entire course. I wouldn't say it, in any way shape or form, made me accept my own mortality, but it kinda.. I'm not sure how to put it, but it makes me less.. something(?). Even if he's fictional, seeing Ivan go from healthy living man to dead is almost sort of cathartic.

The best way I can put it is, imagine you're about to skydive and you're absolutely horrified. You're standing at the plane door too scared to jump, but then you remember seeing some cartoon character do it and it eases your mind just enough to get you over the edge and jump. You know the character and situation was fictional, but for some reason you rationalize it as ""well, if they got through it so can I."" 

That's what Ivan Iliych did for me and death. I'm not any less afraid nor accepting of it, but I now have the mentality of ""he managed to get through this, so I can too.""

Anyway gushing and existentialism over. It's a great book. If you find your self mortified at your mortality, try giving this a read.",1,-23.0,0,23.0,21
"Ronnie Spector (Be My Baby Memoir) A Real Flower in the Attics Life  I finally decided to get around to reading/listening to Ronnie Spector's memoir and **BA-BY!** A true horror story one would think Stephen King made it up. Sadly, for Ronnie her years with her ex weren't just a story, it was her real life.  


Ronnie really did live an incredible life. Singing at the Apollo at age 11, singing at the Peppermint Lounge, getting singed with her sister and cousin Estelle and Nedra, to hanging out and touring with the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. Ronnie chilling with David Bowie, Billy Joel, the Beach Boys, the Ramones, the Misfits who loved the Ronettes. Ronnie having a kickass friendship with Cher and Darlene Love. Ronnie was the ultimate bad girl of Rock N Roll who had her career stopped dead in its tracks because of that Phil Spector.  


Literally from the first time they met, Phil set his eyes on Ronnie and became **OBSESSED** to the tenth degree!  


 I never read her memoir in full which led to me finding out a lot of stuff that I did not know before. 

P Spector was 100% a psychopath, he had issues. He was little twerp of man who was as thin as a twig, and was balding at 22, he got his hooks into Ronnie and did not want to let her go, yet he didn't want for her to be the star that she was and let her sing.  


Some of the things I picked out from the memoir of Phil and Ronnie's marriage:  


**TRIGGER WARNING ABUSE:**  


* After the girls sang for Phil when they first met him, his set his sights on Ronnie when they all went out to eat and immediately singled her out.
* Phil didn't even want to sign Estelle and Nedra he just wanted Ronnie, but Ronnie's mom made it clear that all three were going to be signed together.
* He snatched the phone out Ronnie's hand one time, because his creative process was interrupted by a noise complaint.
* Phil invited Ronnie to his Penthouse to go over a song and when Ronnie saw a bunch of shoes and women's clothes on the floor, he snapped on her and lied and said that those things were his sisters **(it was his wife's**).
* After her mom took her out of the mansion that Phil and Ronnie were living in, after weeks of not being able to locate her, he randomly got in this big accident, and used that to get Ronnie to come back with him.
* Yelled in her face a lot. Cussed her out, called her Bitch a lot.
* R went to Phil's office one time and found his whole office filled and covered with nothing but pictures of **HER**! He had a whole **shrine** of Ronnie.
* R spent her wedding night locked in the bathroom with her mom cause Phil when on a psycho rant/tantrum and accused Ronnie of just marrying him for his money.
* Got in her face and yelled at while they were at the top of the stairs, she got scared and fell down the stairs got a sprained ankle.
* Phil called her a ""little girl"" a lot despite only being 4 years older than her.
* Phil only called Ronnie ""Veronica"", nobody called Ronnie by her full name.
* Phil kept Ronnie in the recording booth with him, away from the other singers/friends of hers and didn't let her sing background vocals with the rest of them. Didn't let her leave the recording booth, she had to sit on a stool. She would hear all of the other artists/her friends laughing and fun together.
* Sent bodyguards to bring her back home if she was gone longer than 20 minutes (**whenever he did actually let her out of their mansion**).
* Didn't get to eat/sleep a lot while in the mansion.
* Phil had intercom systems installed in damn near every room of their mansion.
* Phil took her shoes so that she wouldn't runaway barefoot.
* Phil pulled guns on Ronnie
* Phil threatened to kill Ronnie and put her in a gold coffin.
* Ronnie was threatened by Phil that he was going to have hitman kill her.
* Their mansion barbed wire, electric fences, and big ass guard dogs running around the yards.
* Doors were locked from the inside, Phil and his bodyguards had the keys, and security bars were put on the windows. There was no way for her to get out of that mansion.
* Was physically grabbed/pulled/yanked by Phil when he was angry/jealous.
* Was chased around by Phil in their mansion, ran away from Phil when he came at her violently.
* Was pushed out the door by Phil after a fight. Spent a night at a hotel, was hit in the face by Phil before that.
*  Phil literally locked Ronnie in a **CLOSET**!!!! with a **PADLOCK**!!! Don Kirshner heard her screams/banging on the door and got her out of the closet.
* Ronnie was given a car by Phil for her 25th birthday but had to ride around with a **fake dummy/doll** like Phil and she had to keep it in the seat next to her. He didn't want people thinking that Ronnie was alone.
* Ronnie didn't see a stage or was allowed to sing (**yes even at home in the mansion**) for those years that she was with Phil, it was said that Ronnie couldn't even listen to the radio either.
* Ronnie with her mother's help after a physical fight with Phil, finally escaped the mansion in 1972, and finally divorced him in 1974.
* Eventually won the rights to the music she and the Ronettes made, met her second husband Jonathan Greenfield, remained married to him for 39 years and had two kids together with him.

 The Ronettes deserved so much better! They had years of great music and songs to give to the world, but they couldn't because some dude was too insecure to let a young beautiful, talented, woman be the star that she was. Rest in Peace/Rest in Heaven Ronnie and Estelle. 

I didn't realize how deep Ronnie's story goes. Did anybody else know Ronnie and her group the Ronettes history before her memoir came out?",1,-21.0,0,21.0,51
"The Song of Achilles would have been a way better book if it was told from Achilles' pov. When I first read Song of Achilles I felt very disappointed because it was so hyped up everywhere. At a certain point I felt like the book was just going on and on without end and I had to even put it down for a few weeks. Don't get me wrong I believe that the author is very skilled and her writing style was beautiful but I felt like all the potential in this book was wasted. The potential of a story from Achilles' pov would have been way better than Patroclus' and here's why.

* Patroclus is a great character in the Iliad, and what little we got from him I enjoyed. Unfortunately, the most iconic aspect of Patroclus' character was his death and not his ACTUAL character, like his personality and motives. I'm not sure if this is just that Patroclus is heavily insecure about himself, but he rarely talks ABOUT himself, always about Achilles. Achilles is great but we already know him. Patroclus' pov did nothing but glorify and praise Achilles with little to no attention regarding himself. By seeing in Achilles' pov, we could have understood more why he loved Patroclus so much and be told information we already know.
* The romance felt one-sided on Patroclus' part. Patroclus has done many things showing that he loved Achilles ~~almost too much~~ he went to war with him, he was constantly by his side no matter what, he forgave Achilles for almost everything super quickly, he kissed Achilles first, i can probably say more if I went back into the book and wrote it all out. But Achilles seems like he doesn't really care about Patroclus or his feelings until the moment Patroclus is dead. We need to see passion on Achilles' part to understand his justified anger when Patroclus is killed. 
* Achilles' personality was bland because of Patroclus (unfortunately). Because Patroclus almost refuses to genuinely criticize Achilles (ever) until the end and even then he's not as angry as I expected him to be. Achilles is portrayed as this beautiful, talented, strong, intelligent, and brave force of nature, but his negative traits is pretty much non-existent, He never shows the rage, nor the arrogance and childishness that he has later on in the Trojan War. He's just perfect all the time and that's boring (and ruins the romance even more). 

(Note: This wasn't a planned out rant I just genuinely needed to get this off my mind. Fortunately, I did read a fanfic of song of Achilles that scratched the itch I had ever since I read Song of Achilles, so that's great.)",0,20.0,1,20.0,5
"Ulysses - Joyce sabotages a nascent reader 

It was about 7 years ago that I fondly desired to read. And I mean everything, from Homer to ..Murakami! I wanted to start with the most remarkable books of all time, needing to fill my lack of literacy and take a breath in the air of the finest novelists. 

I immediately realized that the trip should have been very long and that it was impossible to take that excessively deep line because I was a bit late for such profoundness, already 33 years old. Then, as Zappa accurately quoted, ""So many books, so little time"". So the simple choice was to google the great lists, those with the all-timers! 

Since then I enjoyed reading, here there and everywhere!

Anyhow, for the 20th century, among Camus, Proust, Hesse, Hemingway, Kafka, Zola, Nabokov and others, my trip led me to the mighty James Joyce and his masterpiece, Ulysses. I have completed the first two chapters of the book and I dare to say, is a struggle. Calvary. It's impossible that this is the only read since I started, that puts me unceasingly to some tormenting, challenging and oblivious task. Invites me to perceive sensing into a gigantic system, rich in significant notions and approaches, even through simple words, that end up quite empty in my mind. Feels like it offers many straphangers to choose from but I can't grab a single one. 

Perhaps it's a matter of poor translation, hence I tested to read it in English but was more harmful. It is possible that this is not the correct book from Joyce's bibliography to start with. I repeatedly understand that reading is not just moving your eyes through the lines, but feeling intense emotions and satisfying your senses within the cosmos of the mastermind behind it. And I also experience that you have to be completely involved, to absorb whichever imaginative quality generously provides you.

 I gave all of myself to Ulysses, as hard as possible. That experience (let's overreact a little more) drops off part of my self-esteem. Let's put it simply. I feel stupid reading Ulysses. Maybe I am, why not?

So, I was wondering if I have to keep reading it because redemption is soon to be here, kind of ""have faith, my son!"" Or shall I put it in the ""freezer"" for a little while and step inside this pandemonium later in my reading career? Shall I start the James Joyce experience with some other work and then turn back to this one?",0,19.0,1,19.0,297
"Fairy Tale by Stephen King. I’m going to start this by saying I’m *very* fond of Stephen King. I haven’t read all of his books or seen all the movies but I watch and read a lot. I’ve loved everything of his I’ve seen and read so far. Fairy Tale is an exception to the rule. 

The first half or so of the book is as good as expected for King fans. It’s his usual creepy crawly setup where you’re not entirely sure who the monster is. I love that since I’m usually too dense to guess what it is or what’s going on. It’s part of the joy. 

Then we get to the 2nd part of the book where the fairy tale references start and King has his monster coming. Without the narrator of the audiobook I feel like this half kind of would have fallen on its face. I love and knew every reference. I knew everything going on in the stories and as a result could quickly figure out what was happening for once. One reference in particular basically gave me the ending at one point which honestly almost made me turn the audiobook off.

"A nasty kind of high: ""A Scanner Darkly"" by Philip K. Dick. So tonight I've wrapped up reading Philip K. Dick's ""A Scanner Darkly"" and, well, I was taken on a mighty bizarre trip!

This novel, set in  a dystopic  California, revolves around a mind altering drug known as substance D (also known as death in the book). Substance D is not an ordinary drug, for it not only alters the mind but it literally splits it in half. 

And of course the two main characters, or should we say character. Fred a law enforcement officer who wears a camouflaging device known as a scrambler suit. And Bob Arctor a substance D dealer who also takes the drug himself. Fred actively pursues Arctor, but what they don't realize, as a result of the effects of substance D, they are both the same person and both become completely paranoid as time goes on. Bob avoids Fred while Fred avoids his own bosses.

This is how the Seattle Post-Intelligencer describes the book best,""Shot through with schizophrenia, paranoia and the inability to know what is real."" Can't argue with that! Philip K. Dick use of the concept of identity is very prevalent in this work and it works well.",1,-18.0,0,18.0,1
